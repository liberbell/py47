Well, if it isn't my<br>favorite photographer.<br><br>Betsy. I<br>thought we discussed that I...<br><br>Your little ""Eat, Pray, Love""<br>stint away from photography?<br><br>Uh-huh.

I can't quit my day job.<br><br>You could think about it.<br><br>Well, thanks for knocking.<br><br>Oh, I knocked.<br><br>I rang the doorbell, called,<br>texted, sent a couple emails.<br><br>Eventually, I just had<br>to come around back.<br><br>Sorry, I...<br><br>I sometimes get a little carried<br>away serenading my plants.<br><br>That's okay. I sing<br>to my plants too.<br><br>It helps them bloom faster.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Oh wow.<br><br>Oh wow.<br><br>I photographed that<br>in the Maldives.<br><br>Is that a ghost orchid?<br><br>Yeah. No, but just<br>don't disturb anything.<br><br>Fair enough.<br><br>It's like I'm back<br>in the jungle again.<br><br>Except you're actually not.<br><br>You're in my very carefully<br>curated gardens, so just...<br><br>All right. Okay.<br><br>I shot that in the Amazon.<br><br>It's on the verge<br>of extinction now.<br><br>Yeah, I know.<br><br>I mean, hence this whole setup.<br><br>I'm trying to preserve as<br>many species as possible.<br><br>I mean, just so many<br>are being destroyed<br><br>by pollution and tourists.<br><br>There are some flowers<br>that are so magical,<br><br>they only bloom<br>every 3,000 years.<br><br>The Youtan.<br><br>You know about that?<br><br>It's the stuff of legends.<br><br>Only mentioned in ancient<br>Buddhist scriptures.<br><br>Blooms once every 3,000 years.<br><br>That might be the only flower<br>that I've not photographed.<br><br>You know, I used to<br>read this great blog.<br><br>""Hunt for the Youtan"".<br><br>Yeah! That's the one.<br><br>I was obsessed.<br><br>Then they stopped posting.<br><br>That's my blog.<br><br>No, it's not.<br><br>No, really!

We...<br><br>I need to get back to work, but can we<br>get together later and discuss the Youtan,<br><br>just from one flower<br>fan to another?<br><br>Yeah, of course.<br><br>I'll just warn you. It<br>is a lot of information. So.<br><br>Good.<br><br>- Great.<br>- Great.<br><br>Good. Good and great.<br><br>Good, good, and great.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Okay.<br><br>I'll put these upstairs.<br><br>After work.<br><br>- Don't forget.<br>- I'll see you then.<br><br>- All right.<br>- Okay.<br><br>One day.<br><br>Okay.

She was sweet.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>She used to sneak me candies<br>when Gramps wasn't looking.<br><br>She gave you candy?<br><br>- Yeah.<br>- No, stop it!<br><br>I was never allowed to eat<br>anything sweet! Not once.<br><br>Didn't you keep gum<br>stuck in your braces,<br><br>like all the time?<br><br>Your memory is<br>irritatingly accurate.<br><br>I miss her so much.<br><br>I was sorry to hear<br>about her passing.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>She pushed me towards<br>my dreams, you know?<br><br>And that, that was botany.<br><br>Just examining a<br>plant's structure,<br><br>it's genetic, it's<br>ecology, just...<br><br>everything.<br><br>That's why I have<br>the garden now,<br><br>so I can still feel<br>like scientist, I guess.<br><br>Whoa, whoa, whoa.<br><br>You still are very much<br>so scientist, okay?<br><br>I, for one, miss<br>your blog posts.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>I kinda just...<br><br>stopped.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Okay. Is this an interrogation?<br><br>Listen, flower hunk, I'm...<br><br>That is a nickname that<br>my best friend calls you,<br><br>and I...<br><br>I definitely do not use that.<br><br>That would be so embarrassing<br>if I said that to you.<br><br>That would be<br>mortifying actually.<br><br>Well, I like it a lot<br>better than ""book thief.""<br><br>Well, hey, your story is<br>not written in stone, okay?<br><br>You can always go back into<br>science and research and...<br><br>blogging.<br><br>Look at me.<br><br>I'm getting back into law.<br><br>Back?<br><br>I'm so sorry.

A thousand times yes!<br><br>You can make that<br>happen, can't you?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>This thing is<br>actually pretty warm.<br><br>I swear I'm going to fix<br>the AC one of these days.<br><br>You were amazing today.<br><br>Boris and Olivia and me<br>are lucky to have you.<br><br>Well, they are very<br>lucky to have you.<br><br>Well, speaking of<br>people in our life being<br><br>- lucky to have us...<br>- No, don't.<br><br>Don't start it.<br><br>So...<br><br>How's the flower hunk?<br><br>Okay...<br><br>He has a girlfriend.<br><br>And even if he didn't<br>have a girlfriend,<br><br>Jack and I, we are just<br>highly incompatible.<br><br>I mean, he is a no airbags,<br>no filter kind of thinker,<br><br>or should I even<br>say non-thinker?<br><br>That sounds dreamy.<br><br>Well, speaking of dreams,<br><br>I guess he has awakened<br>something in me.<br><br>I found an old photo of me<br>and my favorite professor!<br><br>Dr. Rose?<br><br>Yeah, I was thinking<br>about reaching out to her,<br><br>but I just feel like she had<br>such high hopes for me, and...<br><br>I think she'd love<br>to hear from you.<br><br>I doubt it.<br><br>Why don't you just<br>give her a call?<br><br>Well, now you sound like Jack!<br><br>Did I just hear my name?<br><br>We were just recommending<br>your photography.<br><br>Yeah, we definitely were<br>not talking about you<br><br>in any other capacity.<br><br>We were just working.<br><br>Well, it is Michael Buble<br>and bubble bath time for me.<br><br>I'm out.<br><br>Uh...<br><br>I don't remember seeing<br>any previously arranged<br><br>flower meetings on the calendar.<br><br>Right.<br><br>See, I was kind<br>of hoping that...<br><br>I can take a look<br>at your research...<br><br>in person, with my own eyes.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>I don't know. I have a lot<br>of work to do around here.<br><br>It's the closest I'm ever<br>gonna get to the actual flower.<br><br>Please?<br><br>Okay, so the Youtan was<br>last seen in this area,<br><br>which the text references...<br><br>Oh, hello!<br><br>See, that's the little<br>miss bookworm I remember.<br><br>I don't know how<br>that got mixed in there.<br><br>What? What?<br><br>Look at you! You're<br>so cute here.<br><br>Still are.<br><br>Well, compliments will<br>get you everywhere.<br><br>Well, you were not lying.<br>This is a ton of research.<br><br>Yeah, well, I mean, I<br>have some recordings<br><br>of oral history, some<br>copies of ancient texts,<br><br>some actual ancient texts,<br><br>and pretty much every book<br>written on the subject.<br><br>Ooh, um...<br><br>Just be careful with that.<br><br>That's Dr. Rose, right?<br><br>The one that you were<br>gonna go to China with?<br><br>See? Told you I was<br>a fan of your blog.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>She and I haven't spoken<br>since I didn't go, so.<br><br>Why not?<br><br>I just had this conversation.<br><br>Look, she had really<br>high hopes for me, and...<br><br>I let her down.<br><br>Ooh, this is work, and<br>it's gonna take a while.<br><br>That's fine. It's getting late.<br><br>I gotta check on Norman.<br><br>Talk to you later?<br><br>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sounds good.<br><br>Hello?<br><br>Hi, Violet. It's Olivia.<br><br>Hi!<br><br>Yeah, I was thinking<br>about what you said<br><br>about your grandparents<br>and how your grandmother<br><br>likes to get to the<br>heart of the matter.<br><br>So, I do have one more request.<br><br>We love your scarlet theme,<br><br>and my grandmother's favorite<br>flower was red milkweed.<br><br>So, I'd like to add<br>that to my bouquet.<br><br>Yeah, of course.<br><br>Of course. Consider it done.<br><br>That's lovely. Thank you.<br><br>Okay, have a good night.<br><br>So, can we add red<br>milkweed to the order?<br><br>See, I knew they<br>were gonna come back<br><br>with their own designs.<br><br>Au contraire, my friend.<br><br>She is having me create an<br>elegant bouquet of red and gold,<br><br>but she wants to<br>include red milkweed,<br><br>because apparently it is her<br>grandmother's favorite flower.<br><br>Violet, that is actually the<br>one flower we don't have.<br><br>Oh!<br><br>But I do know where some<br>grows out in the wild.<br><br>Okay, fantastic!<br><br>Great.

That I have.<br><br>Yeah, well, speaking<br>of traveling...<br><br>I am so sorry that I didn't<br>go with you to China.<br><br>And I backed out<br>at the last minute,<br><br>and I really never got to<br>explain why, and it just...<br><br>Violet, don't.<br><br>I know what it meant<br>for you to continue<br><br>your grandmother's<br>legacy after she passed.<br><br>I never questioned<br>the choice you made.<br><br>Thank you. But...<br><br>I never forgave myself<br>for letting you down.<br><br>Oh, don't be silly, darling.<br><br>You didn't let me down.<br><br>Truth be told, you didn't<br>miss out on anything.<br><br>I just kept running<br>into dead ends.<br><br>I would think the<br>Youtan was in one area,<br><br>and then, poof, nothing.<br><br>But I did have a<br>little rendezvous<br><br>with a professor down there,<br>and he gave me a souvenir.<br><br>Okay. She's awesome.<br><br>""Rendezvous""?<br><br>Now, this map was given to<br>Francois by a Shaolin monk,<br><br>and the legend is that there's<br>not just a single flower;<br><br>there is an entire<br>garden of Youtan.<br><br>Whoa.<br><br>But I think that my adventuring<br>years are behind me.<br><br>Violet, even though<br>you didn't join me,<br><br>you were always my star<br>student, and you always will be.<br><br>Thank you, Dr. Rose.<br><br>Can I take this?<br><br>Thank you, thank you, thank you.<br><br>And if you're ever in the<br>city, please come by the shop.<br><br>I would love to.<br><br>Can I meet you in the garage?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Your grandfather let me in.<br><br>Can we talk?<br><br>Yeah, of course.<br><br>Listen, your happiness<br>is important to me.<br><br>I would hate myself<br>if I felt like I...<br><br>forced you down a path<br>you didn't want to go.<br><br>And I appreciate you<br>being honest with me.<br><br>But if I'm being honest...<br><br>Well...<br><br>you make me happy.<br><br>But this relationship...<br><br>doesn't.<br><br>I know.<br><br>I've been feeling the same way.<br><br>You are an amazing<br>woman, Angelica.<br><br>You're smart and driven,<br><br>and I don't want to hurt you.<br><br>I wish that I could<br>just magically become<br><br>the man that you<br>want me to be, but...<br><br>that's not who I am.<br><br>I know.<br><br>Good luck, Jack.<br><br>Hey.<br><br>You okay?<br><br>Yeah, I think so.<br><br>Or...<br><br>I will be.<br><br>So, what are we looking at?<br><br>Okay, there's gotta be<br>connection here, a missing link,<br><br>something, literally anything.<br><br>All right, well, you<br>hold that thought.<br><br>I'm gonna go water<br>the succulents.<br><br>Water spill-off.<br><br>Moisture, dirt, darkness.<br><br>It's caves!<br><br>It's do what now?<br><br>Everywhere the Youtan grew<br>was in the damp and dark,<br><br>and everywhere it was<br>spotted with near...<br><br>Dark and damp something.<br><br>Okay, so it was last<br>seen in this shaded field<br><br>and near this mountain base,<br><br>But given how delicate<br>the flower is,<br><br>one gust of wind and it's...<br><br>- Gone.<br>- Exactly!<br><br>And in order for the<br>Youtan to survive,<br><br>it would need a controlled,<br>dark and damp environment<br><br>like a cave!<br><br>Like a cave. You are a genius.<br><br>Look at this.<br><br>Everything lines<br>up with the scroll.<br><br>See?<br><br>That's a match.<br><br>The Youtan has got to be there.<br><br>Okay, I just want to cross-<br>reference it with my notes.<br><br>Yeah. Let's go.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Do you need this one?<br><br>- I don't think so.<br>- Okay.<br><br>Why is it so hot in here?<br><br>Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!<br><br>It's all ruined!<br><br>Everything!<br><br>Jack, how did I let this happen?<br><br>That's okay. We can fix this.<br><br>How? The wedding is on Saturday!<br><br>I'll help, okay? I can...<br><br>Even if you help people, even<br>if we got more flowers, I...<br><br>I still have to get a new<br>AC unit and install it.<br><br>It's over.<br><br>I ruined everything.<br><br>I lost the biggest client<br>my best friend has ever had.<br><br>My grandmother would be<br>so disappointed in me.<br><br>I'm sorry, but...<br><br>What if this is<br>actually a good thing?<br><br>How is this possibly<br>a good thing?<br><br>I don't mean this. I just<br>mean in the big picture.<br><br>What if this is a wake up call?<br><br>I get it.<br><br>You love this shop,<br><br>and you're an incredibly<br>talented florist,<br><br>but that's not your passion.<br><br>Violet, we can do it.<br><br>We can go find the Youtan.<br><br>What?<br><br>I turned down the job offer.<br><br>Angelica and I broke up.<br><br>We can go.<br><br>Are you kidding me right now?<br><br>I can't just go to China! Okay?<br><br>Jack, look what<br>happened when I...<br><br>I just dropped the<br>ball for an afternoon!<br><br>I have to stay here,<br>and I have to fix this.<br><br>Do you though?<br><br>Yeah!<br><br>But really, do you?<br><br>Because for years, your dream<br>has been to find the Youtan,<br><br>And now you can.<br><br>Don't turn your back on<br>it for a second time.<br><br>You know what, Jack?<br><br>I'm so glad that you can<br>live your life that way.<br><br>I don't turn my back on my<br>friends or my responsibilities.<br><br>I am so sorry that I<br>can't just change my life<br><br>on a whim like you.<br><br>There was a reason<br>that my research<br><br>needed to stay in that box.<br><br>It was to remind me to<br>focus on what is real.<br><br>Not some stupid goose chase.<br><br>So just, can you go?<br><br>Please? Please, Jack, just go.<br><br>I'm sorry. Nothing I said came<br>out the way that I meant for it to.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>Hello?<br><br>The gods have answered<br>in record time,<br><br>and mama's goin' shoppin'.<br><br>Sorry?<br><br>I wrangled you a research permit<br><br>so you can go look<br>for your flower.<br><br>Hello?<br><br>Cancel it.<br><br>It'd be wrong to<br>search for the Youtan<br><br>without its lead authority.<br><br>Look, I don't know exactly<br>what's going on with you, Jack,<br><br>but finding this flower<br>has been your dream<br><br>for as long as I've known you.<br><br>Believe me, I know.<br><br>You're...<br><br>You're so stupid.<br><br>So stupid.<br><br>You're such an idiot!<br><br>Nobody is home!<br><br>Nobody's home!<br><br>Honey.<br><br>It's okay.<br><br>It's okay.<br><br>And I've got the<br>perfect medicine.<br><br>Ugh!<br><br>This is your fear talking.<br><br>I told you, I really don't<br>want to talk about it.<br><br>No, no, no. This has<br>nothing to do with Jack.<br><br>Okay, well, maybe a little bit.<br><br>But, you know, he brought<br>your dreams to the surface,<br><br>and that's a good thing.<br><br>You have been hiding<br>away for too long.<br><br>If you don't just<br>act on your dreams,<br><br>just break out of your comfort<br>zone and face your fear,<br><br>you are gonna live<br>a life of regret.<br><br>What are you, a<br>part-time counselor now?<br><br>Honey, I am a wedding planner.<br><br>Same thing.<br><br>I swear, I will get to it<br>someday, but for right now,<br><br>what are we gonna do<br>about Boris and Olivia?<br><br>I will handle Bolivia, okay?<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Okay.<br><br>- Good night.<br>- Good night.<br><br>And Violet, don't<br>let some day...<br><br>become never.<br><br>I don't have quite the<br>skills in the kitchen you do.<br><br>There it is.<br><br>Thanks, Grandpa. I'm...<br><br>I'm just not that hungry.<br><br>Well, you got messed up<br>written all over you.<br><br>Yeah. I...<br><br>I screwed up everything.<br><br>Can't be that bad.<br><br>Angelica and I broke up.<br><br>Maybe that's for the best.<br><br>Then I went and ruined<br>everything with Violet.<br><br>What happened?<br><br>I was an idiot.<br><br>I tried to push her out of<br>her comfort zone too soon.<br><br>""The greatest warriors<br>are time and patience.""<br><br>Tolstoy.<br><br>I think I just need<br>to take some time,<br><br>figure stuff out, you know?<br><br>That's usually not a bad idea.<br><br>You know...<br><br>life changes are hard, Jack.<br><br>Sometimes they can be scary.<br><br>But we all make it through.<br><br>Matter of fact, I<br>think I might be making<br><br>some changes of my own.<br><br>I love you, Grandpa.<br><br>I love you too, boy.<br><br>You gonna be all right.<br><br>How did I sleep so late?<br><br>Surprise!<br><br>Oh!<br><br>Uh...<br><br>Isn't it just a dream?<br><br>Is it? Am I awake right now?<br><br>Before you freak out,<br>I spoke with Jack.<br><br>You what?<br><br>He did this. All of it!<br><br>He even got the AC fixed.<br><br>And when Cindy<br>told us what happened...<br><br>We came right over.<br><br>I can't believe you<br>found the red milkweed.<br><br>And, if it's all right, we<br>want to get married here!<br><br>In your shop!<br><br>Just us and a couple<br>of our friends,<br><br>and you and Cindy, of course.<br><br>And Gary.<br><br>Here? Here?<br><br>You want to get married here?<br><br>Well, it's here where we<br>rekindled our romance.<br><br>You can say where our<br>romance bloomed again.<br><br>So you aren't firing us?<br><br>Of course not!<br><br>Absolutely not!<br><br>Oh, come on,<br>everyone! Group hug!<br><br>Wow, I...<br><br>You guys, I really<br>don't know what to say.<br><br>I think if you have<br>anything to say,<br><br>you should probably<br>say it to Jack first.<br><br>He left you this.<br><br>What?<br><br>Oh, Jack.<br><br>Violet, I won't bother you anymore<br><br>or tell you what to do<br><br>or try to fix things<br>that aren't my business.<br><br>I hope the flowers and AC<br>help show how sorry I am.<br><br>Jack.<br><br>Oh my goodness.<br><br>Honey...<br><br>go get your man.<br><br>Are you sure? There's so<br>much work to do in here.<br><br>In love and crafts,<br>rule number one,<br><br>don't wait for the glue to dry.<br><br>Go!<br><br>Okay! Okay!<br><br>Set the AC to 10 and...<br><br>I'm gonna go get my man!<br><br>Call Jack Walker.<br><br>Hey, you've<br>reached Jack. Leave a message.<br><br>Hey, how goes it<br>this morning, Violet?<br><br>It's going.<br><br>Hey, Jack, it's Violet.<br><br>Just...<br><br>I really need to talk to you.<br><br>Call me back, okay?<br><br>I should've stretched<br>before all of this.<br><br>What in the...<br><br>Oh, lordy.<br><br>Violet?<br><br>Hi, Norman!<br><br>I literally just ran out of gas<br><br>because I wasn't<br>paying attention.<br><br>I was at the market trying to<br>find Jack and he wasn't there,<br><br>so I thought maybe he'd be here.<br><br>Why is...<br><br>What's going on? Why is the<br>flower stand all torn apart?<br><br>I decided to say goodbye<br>to the stand today.<br><br>What?<br><br>I'm throwing in the towel. And<br>it's a good thing Jack had a place<br><br>to take all of my flowers.<br><br>I really can't think<br>about puttin' around<br><br>in that empty house,<br><br>but I think my body's<br>telling me it's time.<br><br>Big life changes<br>can be daunting.<br><br>That they can.<br><br>Hon, you know, sometimes<br>you just gotta know<br><br>when to call it quits.<br><br>And when to go for it.<br><br>I finally know that, and that<br>is why I came here today.<br><br>I'm trying to get ahold of Jack,<br><br>but he's not answering his<br>phone, and I gotta talk to him.<br><br>Well, you know, the reception<br>at his old thinking place<br><br>isn't the greatest.<br><br>Norman! Of course, of course!<br><br>He's at his thinking place!<br><br>I am, in fact, out of gas.<br><br>Well, I'd offer you a can,<br>but all mine are empty.<br><br>But there is a solution.<br><br>Take his Vespa.<br><br>Oh!<br><br>Oh, it's a piece of cake.<br><br>Marge and I used to<br>ride real motorcycles.<br><br>This thing is just a glorified<br>bicycle with an engine.<br><br>It doesn't even have gears.<br>You just on it and go,<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>I choose the danger.<br><br>Good luck, kid.<br><br>Go get him.<br><br>It's go time.<br><br>Whoa!<br><br>Come on, Violet.<br><br>Come on, you got this.<br><br>Nope!<br><br>Just go.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>There's not a hole there.<br><br>I'm totally fine.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Finally!<br><br>Violet?<br><br>Norman said you were<br>at your thinking spot,<br><br>so I just, I figured-<br><br>What are you doing here?<br><br>Well...<br><br>I've been trying to<br>call you all day.<br><br>Phone's been turned off and...<br><br>honestly, I didn't<br>think I'd hear from him.<br><br>My grandmother told me<br>that everyone's dreams<br><br>are different, and her<br>dream was the flower shop,<br><br>and she poured her heart<br>and her soul into it,<br><br>and she loved it.<br><br>I loved it, too, and she knew<br>that was never gonna be me,<br><br>and my life, and<br>she was so proud<br><br>of who and what I<br>was becoming, but...<br><br>when she died, I felt like<br>I had to honor her legacy<br><br>by staying here, but now I<br>don't even think that's true,<br><br>and I don't think that's<br>what she would've wanted.<br><br>Just...<br><br>What I'm trying to say...<br><br>is that I am so sorry for<br>how I acted yesterday.<br><br>Things were just moving so fast.<br><br>Don't apologize, okay? That...<br><br>That's on me. I did that<br>guy thing where I just...<br><br>I don't know, and I rushed in<br>and tried to fix everything<br><br>without stopping to<br>think and listen.<br><br>I was insensitive.<br><br>No, you weren't.<br><br>What you did for the shop?<br><br>The flowers, the<br>air conditioning?<br><br>No one has ever done anything<br>like that for me before.<br><br>I was happy to do it.<br><br>But I shouldn't have pushed you.<br><br>No, I needed to be pushed.<br><br>Cindy's right. I have<br>to banish my fear.<br><br>Fear is huge.<br><br>Trust me, I know.<br><br>I've been all over the place<br><br>with what I want<br>out of life lately,<br><br>and what you said last night<br>really hit home for me.<br><br>Taking responsibility. Relationships.<br><br>So, I've decided I am gonna<br>start practicing law again.<br><br>Not with Angelica's father,<br><br>but there's a small firm in town<br><br>that specializes in<br>environmental conservation.<br><br>That way I can keep<br>an eye on Norm.<br><br>I don't have to be on the road<br>12 months out of the year.<br><br>I still get to do<br>something I love.<br><br>I have photographed every<br>flower I've ever wanted.<br><br>Except for one<br><br>I'm just gonna have to leave<br>that one to you, Violet.<br><br>Sorry. It might be work.<br><br>Or a text message from Cindy.<br><br>Is everything okay?<br><br>Yeah, just a lot of<br>changes for the wedding.<br><br>We have so much crap to<br>do with the new venue.<br><br>What can I do to help?<br><br>I mean it.<br><br>Well, I can always use some help<br><br>from a fellow flower expert.<br><br>Oh, so I'm an expert now?<br><br>We'll see.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Let's sort these from Scarlet<br>to dark gold in three rows.<br><br>Yes, ma'am.<br><br>You know, this is<br>actually really peaceful.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>It is, isn't it?<br><br>Hey, do you think that<br>Norman would want to help?<br><br>Are you kidding me? He<br>would jump at the chance.<br><br>- Yeah?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Would you look at this!<br><br>Gosh, this brings<br>back so many memories.<br><br>You remind me so much<br>of your grandmother.<br><br>Aw, thanks, Norman.<br><br>Hey, how would you feel<br>about looking after my shop<br><br>here and there?<br><br>Oh, I would love that.<br><br>Really?<br><br>'Cause I couldn't leave<br>my shop with just anyone,<br><br>but I think you'd be perfect.<br><br>Oh!<br><br>Gramps, take it easy,<br>man. What are you doing?<br><br>Norman, your leg!<br><br>My leg hasn't felt<br>this good in years!<br><br>So, are we just<br>gonna stand here?<br><br>Let's get working, huh?<br><br>Okay, head on back.<br><br>You plan on going somewhere?<br><br>Dr. Rose!<br><br>Well, I was in town,<br><br>and I thought I would<br>take you up on your offer<br><br>to see the shop.<br><br>Oh, thank you so much!<br><br>We're actually getting ready<br>for a wedding, and it's...<br><br>I brought refreshments!<br><br>And I brought snacks!<br><br>Wow. I guess it's a party now.<br><br>Nope. Keep coming this way.<br><br>This way. Closer.<br><br>What do you think about this?<br><br>Ooh, let me see.<br><br>Oh, put it down.<br><br>Jack, this<br>looks amazing. Thank you.<br><br>Yes, yes, we can do that. Okay.<br><br>No, I'm good.<br><br>Thank you for today.<br><br>For everything.<br><br>I should be thanking you.<br><br>What you did for Norman was...<br><br>It was sweet.<br><br>Well, I meant it.<br><br>Ah, well...<br><br>We've got a big day tomorrow.<br><br>We?<br><br>Am I invited to the wedding?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>I mean, it's gonna<br>be all hands on deck,<br><br>so we need to make<br>sure it runs smoothly.<br><br>Okay.

out.<br><br>I've been sitting<br>in there for months.<br><br>You realize how boring that is?<br><br>That little house didn't<br>even have cable TV.<br><br>Now listen kids, I need<br>your help to get back<br><br>to Santa's workshop.<br><br>'Cause I'm the one<br>who's in charge,<br><br>of making the reindeer<br>fly on Christmas Eve<br><br>and if they don't fly,<br><br>well there's no Christmas<br>presents for anyone.<br><br>Capisce?<br><br>- But why do you need our help?<br><br>- Because I'm only half<br>an inch high, that's why.<br><br>Somebody's gonna step on me.<br><br>- Okay, you don't need to<br>shout, we'll go with you.<br><br>- Oh thank you.<br><br>- But how do we get there?<br><br>We're not old enough to drive<br><br>and you're not big enough.<br><br>- It's a cinch, you know that<br>ice is frozen water right?<br><br>Well mirrors are frozen magic!<br><br>They separate the real<br>world from the magic world.<br><br>- Real magic?<br><br>- Of course it's real magic.<br><br>You think I'd waste<br>my time on fake magic?<br><br>You ain't seen nothing yet.<br><br>- Cool!<br><br>- It's melting.<br><br>- Don't worry about it.<br><br>As long as you come back<br><br>through the mirror before<br>it melts all the way,<br><br>you can get back to your house.<br><br>You guys ready to go?<br><br>- You want us to hop<br>through the mirror with you,<br><br>just like that?<br><br>- Yes.<br><br>- What are we waiting for?<br><br>Let's go!<br><br>- But I've gotta pack.<br><br>And I'll need traveler's checks.<br><br>I'll need shots and.<br><br>- I'm waiting.<br><br>At the rate you're moving,<br><br>I'm gonna be ready<br>for the old elf home,<br><br>before we get to the North Pole.<br><br>- [Alex] So let's go.<br><br>- [Heidi] Alex, wait!<br><br>- Uh oh, now they've done it.<br><br>Ah!<br><br>- Is this Santa's workshop?<br><br>- No it doesn't even look<br>like Santa's workshop,<br><br>it doesn't even smell<br>like Santa's workshop.<br><br>It's not Santa's workshop, okay.<br><br>It's all because you jumped<br><br>through the mirror<br>before I was ready.<br><br>Oh now we're gonna have to walk.<br><br>- But you said you<br>wanted to get going.<br><br>- I did not.<br><br>- Did too.<br><br>- Did not.<br><br>- Did too.<br><br>- Did not!<br><br>- Did not.<br><br>- Did too.<br><br>- Told you so.<br><br>- That's the last time I get<br>into a debate with you kid.<br><br>So let's get going already.<br><br>- Shoo!<br><br>- Pinocchio, you've<br>been telling lies again!<br><br>- I'm afraid you're right.<br><br>See I told the truth.<br><br>What brings you folks to<br>this part of the forest?<br><br>- We're on our way back<br>to Santa's workshop.<br><br>- Do you know the way<br>to the North Pole?<br><br>- Sure I do, I've been<br>there a hundred times, yeah.<br><br>- Are you sure about this?<br><br>- Sure I'm sure,<br>Santa and I used<br><br>to double-date every<br>Saturday night.<br><br>- Yeah but can you<br>show us the way?<br><br>- No problem, you'll<br>be there in no time.<br><br>Well, maybe I know the way<br><br>but it might take<br>you a little while.<br><br>Okay, okay, I have no idea<br>where the North Pole is<br><br>and you might as well give<br>up all hope right now.<br><br>Stop the cartoon, these people<br>are doomed, toast, kaput.<br><br>- Cut that out, get<br>outta here, scram.<br><br>We got another half hour<br>of cartoon to go here.<br><br>Don't you have<br>any advice for us?<br><br>- North is that way.<br><br>- Come on kids.<br><br>- I tell you, they're toast.<br><br>Absolute toast.<br><br>- Should they start the test?<br><br>- Yes, go ahead.<br><br>I just hope this one works.<br><br>- Start the test!<br><br>- Start the test.<br><br>One, two, three, fly!<br><br>- It's still not working.<br><br>Oh it's only a couple of<br>hours before I have to leave.<br><br>- This is all Irv's fault.<br><br>He was the one who sabotaged<br>the production line.<br><br>And he was the one in charge<br>of making the reindeer fly.<br><br>- I know, I know.<br><br>I just don't understand<br>how he could turn out<br><br>to be so bad.<br><br>- Santa's gonna be<br>so happy to see me.<br><br>He's probably worried sick.<br><br>- Hurry, hurry, hurry.<br><br>No time to waste.<br><br>Buy this soda can emptier.<br><br>It empties the can<br>before you drink it.<br><br>What could be more efficient?<br><br>- Scram, we ain't interested.<br><br>- Ah there's more.<br><br>Are you tired of pesky insects?<br><br>Well I have something<br>that's absolutely guaranteed<br><br>to esquirmanate any<br>insect on earth.<br><br>Simply place the offending<br>insect on this block,<br><br>then hit it with<br>this special hammer.<br><br>And then repeat if necessary.<br><br>And now for my most<br>spectacular offering.<br><br>Not available in stores.<br><br>This is a one time offer.<br><br>Hurry, hurry, hurry!<br><br>A magic bean guaranteed<br><br>to grow into an absolutely<br>humongous bean stalk!<br><br>If it doesn't grow,<br>just try to find me.<br><br>- I told you we<br>ain't interested.<br><br>Come on kids let's go.<br><br>- I want it.<br><br>- And it's only 2,000 bucks!<br><br>Will that be cash<br>or credit card?<br><br>I don't have any money.<br><br>- Well luckily for you,<br><br>I have a special<br>year-end clearance sale<br>going on right now.<br><br>Give me your watch<br>and it's yours kid.<br><br>- Don't do it.<br><br>- Sold, it's been a pleasure<br>doing business with ya.<br><br>- Wow a magic bean.<br><br>- [Heidi] What's that?<br><br>- Is that Santa's workshop?<br><br>- Ah no.<br><br>- Look at all the candy.<br><br>- Don't touch it.<br><br>No don't, oh.<br><br>- Help, let us out!<br><br>Let us out,

I knew you'd<br>make a great team.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Um...<br><br>so I've been thinking<br>about what Jenny said to me<br><br>the first day we met,<br>about my writing.<br><br>Gosh, you must have thought<br>I was so arrogant.<br><br>No, no, no.<br><br>I think you're passionate<br>and uncompromising<br><br>and... hanging out with you<br>has made me realize<br><br>that I've been settling<br>for second best<br><br>in more ways than one.<br><br>She has that effect on people.<br><br>What I'm trying to say is...<br><br>um... things have happened recently<br><br>and I've had a perspective shift<br><br>and I want to write a new book<br><br>and I want to challenge myself<br>to write something<br><br>that's gonna be honest<br>and meaningful.<br><br>I think that's a great idea.<br><br>Well, um...<br><br>I was hoping you'd want<br>to work on it with me.<br><br>I'd love to see what<br>you could come up with<br><br>on a project that<br>you actually care about.<br><br>Yeah, I'd... I'd...<br><br>I'd really love that.<br><br>Did you have anything in mind?<br><br>Um, I'm toying around<br>with a couple different ideas.<br><br>Well, you should do a book about<br>your grandmother's butterfly.<br><br>You know, the one that<br>flies around the world,<br><br>spreading happiness<br>to everybody.<br><br>Well, only those<br>who don't chase it.<br><br>Yes. That's exactly<br>what we'll do.<br><br>- Right?<br>- God, you're a genius.<br><br>Oh, well, I don't know<br>if you should say ""genius,""<br><br>but if you want<br>to use that word...<br><br>Right.<br><br>Project Butterfly.<br><br>I like it.<br><br>I'm very excited to see<br>where this could go.<br><br>Hey! Sorry, I don't mean to just<br>pop in on you like this<br><br>but I was in the area,<br>thought I'd bring you lunch.<br><br>How sweet of you!<br><br>Can I bring 'em in?<br><br>Oh, um...<br><br>If right now's a bad time,<br>I totally get it,<br><br>- I can come...<br>- Um, no, no, no. No.<br><br>Uh, come in, come in.<br><br>Oh, great.<br><br>All right.<br><br>Are you sure right now<br>isn't a bad time?<br><br>Oh, it's actually great.<br><br>I'm really hungry,<br>so this is perfect.<br><br>Okay, there are plates<br>back there?<br><br>No.<br><br>That's not the kitchen?<br><br>It is the kitchen<br>but it's really messy.<br><br>I'm not gonna judge.<br>It's totally...<br><br>You... you... you just stay<br>right here<br><br>and I will be right back.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>One second!<br><br>Are you sure everything's<br>okay in here?<br><br>- Um, yeah. It's raccoons.<br>- I'm sorry, what?<br><br>Oh, they just get into the trash<br><br>and the noise...<br><br>Do you need me to help?<br><br>They don't like loud noises,<br><br>so yeah, it's all good,<br>they're gone now.<br><br>Oh, okay.<br><br>Um, let's just go into...<br><br>the living room.<br><br>Um, those bagels look delicious.<br><br>So yeah, I've been in Miami<br>for five years now<br><br>and I love it here.<br><br>There's a great music scene,<br><br>there's never been more<br>foot traffic at the gallery.<br><br>It's great.<br><br>That's great.<br><br>I'm just surprised we haven't<br>run into each other before.<br><br>I know. Fate works<br>in mysterious ways, right?<br><br>It really does, doesn't it?<br><br>Is that the book<br>you've been working on?<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Wow. The...<br><br>The art in here<br>is... amazing.<br><br>Seriously, really, really good.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>The writing's<br>a little hacky though,<br><br>I have to say.<br><br>How did this guy<br>get you on board?<br><br>Oh no, he's actually<br>really good.<br><br>He really knows the market.<br><br>Okay, to each their own,<br>I guess.<br><br>I just... I think<br>you can do better, that's all.<br><br>Oh, uh, well, we're working<br>on a new book.<br><br>It has a very different tone.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Oh, geez, I gotta get back.<br><br>I have a meeting<br>this afternoon. Sorry.<br><br>Oh, sounds exciting.<br><br>Well, thank you again for lunch.<br><br>It was a pleasure.<br><br>Hey, I'm really glad that fate<br><br>brought us together eventually.<br><br>I am too.<br><br>Message me, okay?<br>Let's do this again soon.<br><br>- Mm-hm.<br>- Oh, and, uh,<br><br>you should really have<br>an exterminator come out here<br><br>and have a look<br>at those raccoons.<br><br>Whole thing.<br><br>- Right.<br>- See ya.<br><br>Okay, bye!<br><br>♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah<br><br>♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah<br><br>- Hello?<br>- Hey, so, um,<br><br>I was thinking about the book<br><br>and, um, so it could be a series<br><br>and in each story<br>there's a different child<br><br>going through a difficult<br>situation in their lives.<br><br>Uh, yeah. I like it.<br><br>Yeah, and then the butterfly<br><br>is with them<br>the whole way through<br><br>but they don't see it<br><br>and then in the end,<br><br>it sits on their shoulder<br><br>and they realize<br>that whatever it was<br><br>they thought that<br>they were going through,<br><br>it's in the past now<br>and they're through it.<br><br>What do you think?<br><br>Um, yeah, it sounds good,<br>um, but, listen,<br><br>it's getting late and I have<br>a date with Blake tomorrow,<br><br>so, um, do you mind<br>if we get back to this?<br><br>Yeah, sure.<br><br>Okay, bye.<br><br>I do too!<br><br>Scrambled eggs in the morning.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>You know, I've really enjoyed<br>exploring the market with you,<br><br>but, uh, all day there's been<br>something else on my mind.<br><br>Oh, really?<br><br>Well, um,<br>maybe you should tell me<br><br>because maybe it's been<br>on my mind too.<br><br>I'm thinking<br>it probably has been.<br><br>The one time when you almost<br>destroyed a $10,000 sculpture.<br><br>Oh my gosh, $10,000?<br><br>I'm so sorry.<br><br>No, it's totally fine.<br><br>I'm glad you saved it.<br><br>But actually that's not<br><br>what I've been thinking<br>about all day.<br><br>Oh, um...<br><br>I... I think<br>I left my phone inside.<br><br>Yes, I... could you maybe<br>go look for it?<br><br>I... I'm so sorry,<br>I'll take a look here.<br><br>And you... okay, thanks.<br><br>Sorry.<br><br>Gosh.<br><br>Hi!<br><br>Jenny, hi!<br><br>Hi!<br><br>How are you?<br><br>I'm great.<br><br>Great.<br><br>I'm just picking up<br>a few last-minute items<br><br>before my trip.<br><br>How's the prep going?<br><br>Oh, um, it's great.<br><br>There was a couple issues,<br><br>but everything's<br>getting ironed out,<br><br>so it should be good.<br><br>Glad to hear it.<br><br>And Tyler's good?<br><br>- Yes!<br>- Is he with you?<br><br>Oh, he is actually diving,<br>you know, another expedition.<br><br>- Oh, busy guy.<br>- Mm-hm!<br><br>Well, anyways,<br>good luck with everything.<br><br>You too, have a great vacation.<br><br>- Thank you so much.<br>- Okay, bye.<br><br>I'm really sorry, it was gone<br>by the time I got back there.<br><br>Oh, it's fine,<br>don't even worry about it.<br><br>Oh, okay, well, you should<br>at least call the provider<br><br>and have 'em freeze it up<br>for you.<br><br>Oh, okay.<br><br>Oh!<br><br>I am such a scatterbrain.<br><br>I... I am so sorry.<br><br>I must have had it on me<br>the whole time.<br><br>That's okay, that's okay.<br>I'm just glad it back.<br><br>Thank you for checking on it, really.<br><br>You're my hero.<br><br>No worries.<br><br>Um...<br><br>Should we keep looking around?<br><br>- Sure.<br>- Okay.<br><br>You are so lucky you're cute.<br><br>All right, calling her again.<br><br>Let's just start without her.<br><br>Right.<br><br>Your new book.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Well, I love it.<br><br>Really?<br><br>It's on a different level<br><br>than anything else<br>you've ever written.<br><br>I mean,<br>at the heart of the story,<br><br>there's a sadness and a truth,<br><br>but ultimately it teaches<br>that patience has a reward<br><br>greater than any quick fix.<br><br>That's exactly<br>what I was going for.<br><br>So you think this is<br>a good direction for me?<br><br>Most books end up<br>in a grocery bargain bin.<br><br>This one is going to sit<br>on kids' shelves<br><br>for a really long time.<br><br>Has Jenny read it?<br><br>Uh, I sent it to her,<br>but she's been busy.<br><br>She said she was gonna<br>call you yesterday.<br><br>Yeah, well, one word: Blake.<br><br>- Does she know?<br>- Know what?<br><br>That you and Laura broke up.<br><br>What does that have to do<br>with anything?<br><br>Because you like her.<br><br>I don't like her.<br><br>We're collaborators,<br>and she's happy with Blake.<br><br>What kind of name<br>is that anyways? Blake?<br><br>I mean, he sounds like a cheesy,<br>corny soap opera actor.<br><br>Right.<br><br>So you're not jealous<br>at all then.<br><br>Jealous of Blake?<br><br>Blake.<br><br>No, I'm not jealous of Blake.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>What?<br><br>I am so close<br>I can almost taste the canapés.<br><br>I just might need your help<br>with one little challenge.<br><br>I knew it!<br><br>The bachelorette party.<br><br>Okay, not quite,<br>but this could be as fun.<br><br>Go on.<br><br>The wedding is a week away.<br><br>Blake is the one.<br><br>He has to be.<br><br>He just might need<br>a little help realizing it.<br><br>And so this is where we come in.<br><br>Just drop a few hints.<br><br>Tell him not to move so slow<br>and, I don't know,<br><br>maybe proposing<br>would be a good idea.<br><br>You are a 21st century woman.<br><br>You could ask him.<br><br>I don't want to be desperate.<br><br>Really, honey, 'cause I hate<br>to break it to you...<br><br>Okay, I know you two can do it.<br><br>Come on, we're so close.<br><br>We'll do our best.<br><br>Have you read<br>Tyler's manuscript yet?<br><br>It's really special.<br><br>Oh, is it?<br><br>I knew he had it in him.<br><br>But no,<br>I haven't had a chance yet.<br><br>Well, at least give him a call.<br><br>He's been trying<br>to get a hold of you.<br><br>I will. I will call.<br><br>Good luck.<br><br>Is it a display<br>or a fruit stand?<br><br>Oh, I think it has something<br>to do with gravity.<br><br>- Oh, hey, guys.<br>- Hi.<br><br>Uh, is, uh,<br>Jenny not with you today or...<br><br>Oh, no, she's... she's hard<br>at work in her studio.<br><br>And making the magic happen.<br><br>We had the afternoon off,<br><br>so we thought we'd stop by,<br>take a look around.<br><br>This is...<br><br>Interesting piece.<br><br>It is, right?<br><br>We feel that by placing everyday<br>items on display like this,<br><br>it makes people see them<br>in a whole different light.<br><br>- Oh.<br>- Appreciate the art<br><br>behind these objects, you know?<br><br>So like the smoothness<br>of the peel,<br><br>the vibrancy of the red<br>of this apple, you know?<br><br>I was just explaining this<br>to Clara,<br><br>but she doesn't get it.<br><br>She's a philistine.<br><br>It's easy to be cynical<br>about art. I get it.<br><br>But, um, why don't I<br>show you guys around,<br><br>and, um, by the time we're done<br>with the tour of this place,<br><br>you're gonna see it<br>in a whole different light.<br><br>Well, that would be great, thanks.<br><br>I'm not a philistine.<br><br>Oh, and speaking of Jenny, actually,<br><br>and she would hate it<br>if I said this,<br><br>but she hasn't been this happy<br>with a man in a long time.<br><br>Oh, that's true.<br><br>Yeah, I really like her too.<br><br>She's a beautiful person.<br><br>She's had a lot<br>of short-term relationships.<br><br>Yeah, but nothing<br>seems to stick.<br><br>I think she'd really love it<br>if this one went the distance.<br><br>You know, if you were<br>to become more serious,<br><br>I think it would be<br>really good for her.<br><br>Yeah, you can't move too fast<br>with her,<br><br>that's all we're saying.<br><br>Okay, are you guys just dropping<br>not-so-subtle hints right now,<br><br>is that... is that<br>what's going on here?<br><br>It's just that, um,<br>Jenny's our friend,<br><br>and we want what's best for her,<br><br>and you're a really big part<br>of that, Blake.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Let's have a look over here.<br><br>I know we've only<br>known each other<br><br>for a short period of time, right?<br><br>Go on.<br><br>But I think we have something<br>really special here.<br><br>I do too.<br><br>And when you hit your 30s,<br><br>there's just no point<br>in taking things slowly.<br><br>So...<br><br>I have something<br>really important<br><br>that I want to ask you.<br><br>Will you...<br><br>move to Paris with me?<br><br>Oh, I... I didn't want<br>to say anything until now<br><br>'cause I thought it was gonna<br>cast a shadow over things.<br><br>Paris?<br><br>Yeah, I've been offered a job<br><br>managing a gallery<br>right off the Champs-Élysées.<br><br>It's a dream job,<br>and I have to leave tomorrow,<br><br>but if you want to come with me,<br><br>I'll book you a seat<br>on the flight.<br><br>I can't fly to Paris<br>in two days.<br><br>What?<br><br>Did you know about this<br>and not tell me?<br><br>I am telling you right now.<br><br>I don't...<br><br>I don't want us to be over.<br><br>I thought you were<br>gonna propose.<br><br>Oh, gosh.<br><br>I mean, do you have to go?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>It's a huge opportunity for me,<br><br>and I've already signed a lease<br>on an apartment.<br><br>I can't... I can't just turn<br>this opportunity down, Jenny.<br><br>We're supposed to get married<br>in two days.<br><br>Did you think we were gonna go<br>to Vegas or something?<br><br>- No.<br>- Okay, so how<br><br>were we gonna get married<br>in two days then?<br><br>I booked a wedding.<br><br>I'm sorry. What?<br><br>I was supposed to get married<br>on my 35th birthday.<br><br>A fortune teller predicted it.<br><br>I thought that asking you<br><br>to come to Paris with me<br>was rushing things,<br><br>but marriage after<br>just a couple weeks?<br><br>But I've fallen for you.<br><br>You sure?<br><br>Or maybe you just<br>wanted it so bad<br><br>that you convinced yourself<br>of that.<br><br>Jenny, I like you,<br><br>but you have<br>to tell me something.<br><br>Did you have<br>this whole thing planned out<br><br>when you met me?<br><br>Yeah, yeah, that's...<br><br>That is too much.<br><br>It's like everything<br>that we had wasn't real.<br><br>No, it was. It was real.<br><br>You kept this from me<br>the entire time.<br><br>And...<br><br>And now I think it's time<br>for us to go our separate ways.<br><br>I'm really sorry<br>this didn't go how you planned.<br><br>No, just...<br><br>Oh, um, hi.<br><br>Hey. You haven't been answering<br>my calls or emails.<br><br>I just wanted to make sure<br>you have that.<br><br>Um, yeah, thanks.<br><br>Clara said it was really great.<br><br>Yeah, so, you haven't read it.<br><br>I'm sorry, I just haven't<br>gotten the chance yet.<br><br>Yeah, just don't say it.<br><br>It's really not a great time.<br><br>When is?<br><br>I get it.<br><br>You wanted me to help you<br>with your wedding,<br><br>but you never wanted<br>to work with me.<br><br>No, that's not it.<br><br>I didn't in the beginning,<br><br>but... but... but now I do.<br><br>Why do I feel like<br>I'm alone in this?<br><br>I'm sorry, I've just had<br>other things going on.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>And don't we all know it.<br><br>You know, you live<br>in this fantasy world<br><br>where you think that all<br>the cosmos and all the planets,<br><br>they just revolve<br>all around you.<br><br>What about everybody else?<br><br>Huh?<br><br>What about all the people<br>that... that don't have love,<br><br>that aren't gonna have<br>the perfect wedding?<br><br>Was that their fortune<br>that was just laid out for them,<br><br>but Jenny Newlove<br>gets everything that she wants?<br><br>I mean, is that really<br>how you think the world spins?<br><br>Oh, okay, so you were fine<br>to play along<br><br>when it worked for you.<br><br>I worked really hard<br>on Ollie Slick, even though...<br><br>You thought it was dumb.<br><br>I wasn't gonna say that, okay?<br><br>But now you put your heart<br>into something<br><br>and you want me to just<br>drop everything and say,<br><br>""Good for you, Tyler.""<br><br>Great. Congrats.<br><br>You know, you made me<br>believe in myself and I did.<br><br>And I thought we could make<br>something special together,<br><br>and I just wanted<br>to share that with you.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>Fine.<br><br>Let's just drop it.<br><br>Forget about it.<br><br>Tyler.<br><br>Oh, honey.<br><br>Goodness.<br><br>Now that it's all over,<br><br>I just realize<br>what a fool I've been.<br><br>Don't say that.<br><br>I mean, it's okay,<br>you can laugh.<br><br>It's kind of funny, I guess.<br><br>No one's laughing.<br><br>You even had me believing.<br><br>We both wanted this<br>to work out so much.<br><br>Can you still make a go of it<br>with Blake?<br><br>I mean, forget the wedding.<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>I think I was just trying<br>to force something<br><br>that wasn't even there.<br><br>And now I've upset Tyler.<br><br>I mean, he doesn't even want<br>anything to do with me.<br><br>You tell the venue yet?<br><br>No.<br><br>I need to go over<br>and tell them in person.<br><br>I mean, they've put so much<br>hard work into this wedding.<br><br>I... I feel awful.<br><br>No, no, it's okay.<br><br>Actually,<br>why don't we go with you?<br><br>We've been with you<br>since the beginning.<br><br>We might as well see this<br>through to the end.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Oh, I do have one more favor<br>to ask of you though, Aiden.<br><br>What?<br><br>You got this.<br><br>Are those from Clara? Sit here.<br><br>Jenny, actually.<br><br>She asked me to get these to you<br>as soon as I could.<br><br>Oh, um...<br><br>We're not working<br>on the book anymore.<br><br>That's not what she thinks.<br><br>She's busy.<br><br>She's starting her marriage<br>with the perfect man.<br><br>You don't know.<br><br>The wedding's off.<br><br>Blake's on a plane<br>to Paris as we speak.<br><br>He had his chance with<br>the best woman in the world<br><br>and he blew it.<br><br>When did all this happen?<br><br>Yesterday afternoon.<br><br>I need to show these to you.<br><br>She was up half the night<br>working on them.<br><br>Why didn't she tell me?<br><br>Now I've got everything on USB.<br><br>I spoke to the editor.<br><br>She's ready<br>to put pictures to words<br><br>and words to pictures.<br><br>That is, if you still want<br><br>to move forward<br>with this project?<br><br>This is stunning.<br><br>Now I see why you wanted<br>to get married here so much.<br><br>I know.<br><br>But one day,<br>when you have a wedding,<br><br>blow this out of the water.<br><br>Maybe.<br><br>Oh, it will.<br><br>I was just so certain<br><br>that Madam Lotus' predictions<br>would come true.<br><br>Like night follows day,<br><br>I would wake up<br>on my 35th birthday<br><br>and marry the most perfect man.<br><br>And now, my future's<br>just such a mystery.<br><br>Well, that's not a bad thing.<br><br>Yeah, but think<br>of all those years<br><br>that I took for granted,<br><br>thinking that love was<br>just written in the stars.<br><br>Oh, um, excuse me,<br><br>do you know where<br>the events manager is?<br><br>Oh, thanks.<br><br>Jenny, you're already loved<br>so much.<br><br>Think about all the people<br><br>that came to Miami<br>to celebrate with you.<br><br>Right, and now<br>I'm gonna have to tell them<br><br>that I wasted their time.<br><br>Not necessarily.<br><br>I mean,<br>it is still your birthday.<br><br>You hired out<br>this spectacular venue.<br><br>It'd be a shame<br>to see it all go to waste.<br><br>It would be quite<br>the extravagant birthday party.<br><br>Why do you only get<br>to pull out all the stops<br><br>when a man is involved?<br><br>Why don't we celebrate you?<br><br>And all the love<br>people have for you?<br><br>Be right back.<br><br>Oh!<br><br>Hm.<br><br>This is exciting.<br><br>What?

I like riding motorcycles.<br><br>Motorcycles...<br><br>To put it simply...<br><br>It's because they're fast and cool.<br><br>Well...<br><br>I'm kind of obsessed with motorcycles,<br><br>but someone who looks<br>good on a bike is nice.<br><br>In the future, I definitely<br>want to become a solo rider.<br><br>Um...<br><br>Summer vacation and all,<br><br>I wanted to go somewhere,<br>but it was canceled.<br><br>At first, I was a bit disappointed,<br><br>but I was able to become<br>closer with everyone,<br><br>so it was a lot of fun.<br><br>Summer's coming up.<br><br>It's basically already summer.<br><br>At the next cultural festival,<br><br>we'll be playing in a band, but<br><br>we're putting our all into it and...<br><br>it's really fun to be doing<br>that right now, but<br><br>before that, we have a test<br><br>and I'm not really looking forward to that.<br><br>As for my personality...<br><br>It's similar to Ritsuko's character,<br><br>I'm a bit reserved, but<br><br>I might be a bit different<br>from everyone else,<br><br>But I don't think it's a bad thing.<br><br>My type of guy is someone who, well...<br><br>My favorite celebrity is Nakamura Toru,<br><br>but I really just want<br>someone who can protect me.<br><br>And I really like guys<br>who play sports too.<br><br>What's most fun for me right now...<br><br>Going shopping, hanging out with friends,<br><br>and just walking around town chatting<br>with them without any set plans.<br><br>At today's picnic shoot,<br><br>It was so much fun talking<br>and playing with all our friends.<br><br>I hope all of us,<br><br>including you, who<br>watched Stranger House,<br><br>can see each other again soon.<br><br>Bye for now!</div>",https://subslikescript.com/movie/Momoco_Wonderland_Strange_House-25434456

Understand ?<br><br>Right away.<br><br>Be careful. What are you doing ?<br><br>Don't worry. I have a good grip.<br><br>- Let him drive.<br>- Him ?<br><br>Why ?<br><br>Oh, boy, I'm sick. Really sick.<br><br>Get out, get some air. It'll do you good.<br><br>Get behind the wheel-- now!<br><br>Are we close to the river7<br><br>It's probably 600 yards away.<br><br>Well, now I feel better.<br><br>What are you doing, getting out ?<br><br>He's going to drive. You get some rest.<br><br>Let's go.<br><br>Signor Bregana had too much to drink. At some point he got sick.<br><br>You should have been driving. You're the mechanic, aren't you ?<br><br>Yes, but he was saying I didn't know the way.<br><br>You had been drinking too ?<br><br>We were all together, but he had been drinking the most.<br><br>All right, go on.<br><br>After stopping because he was feeling sick,<br><br>he got back behind the wheel and drove three-quarters of a mile.<br><br>Why did you leave the main road to get on the country road ?<br><br>He wanted to get home faster. He took a shortcut.<br><br>Maybe he didn't know the way well and missed the curve.<br><br>He lost control of the car.<br><br>I don't know what happened next.<br><br>It happened in an instant.<br><br>When I opened my eyes I saw a lot of blood.<br><br>How do you suppose it was that your boss died instantly ?<br><br>Perhaps he was pinned down between the steering wheel and the car.<br><br>The impact crushed his head.<br><br>And why do you think Signora Bregana was unhurt ?<br><br>I told you already, I had no time to look.<br><br>She was by the door. Maybe she managed to jump out.<br><br>She jumped with her purse and her hat ?<br><br>With her purse and hat ?<br>What do you mean ?<br><br>The first truck driver who saw Signora Bregana calling for help<br><br>says she was holding onto her purse<br><br>without showing any trace of being in an accident.<br><br>I found them on the ground.<br>I took them to clean off the blood.<br><br>You jumped from the car before it rolled over ?<br><br>Yes. I saw it coming. I opened the door and jumped.<br><br>I asked my husband to let him drive, but he didn't want him to.<br><br>And he was going faster than usual.<br><br>What did you do after that ?<br><br>I came back to the truck. I opened the door...<br><br>and my husband wasn't answering.<br><br>Then he got out.<br><br>Didn't he faint ?<br><br>Yes. That's why I flagged the truck.<br><br>When the drivers arrived, he was already moving on his own.<br><br>Had you been with Signor Bregana for a long time ?<br><br>The first time, I was there a few days.<br><br>But I didn't like being tied down in one place and left.<br><br>Then, we met in Ancona and he insisted I come back.<br><br>So you were traveling around and decided to settle down ?<br><br>Yes, just like that.<br><br>- Do you have anything else to say ?<br>- No.<br><br>Let's go sign the report.<br><br>""Death by accident"", Superintendent ?<br><br>""By accident"".<br>Let's write it that way.<br><br>Let's go back into town now.<br><br>In here is everything he had on him.<br><br>These are the papers to release the body from the morgue.<br><br>Thank you, Superintendent.<br><br>Goodbye, Signora.<br><br>We'll need to get a few more details...<br><br>before closing the investigation.<br>We'll let you know.<br><br>It's hot. Do you want a drink ?<br><br>What is it ? Aren't you happy to be back ?<br><br>I had envisioned it differently, coming back here.<br><br>We have to get used to it.<br><br>When the store opens again<br><br>and there are people around, it'll be easier.<br><br>- We're reopening the store ?<br>- Of course.<br><br>What are you thinking ?<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>I'm happy.<br><br>I still can't believe I'm here...<br><br>alone with you.<br><br>Gino--<br>isn't this what we wanted ?<br><br>Yes. This is what we wanted.<br><br>When I think back to the days I spent behind this counter--<br><br>crying... alone.<br><br>I wouldn't want to go back.<br><br>Who's talking about going back ?<br><br>What's done is done.<br><br>We must love each other very much.<br><br>Otherwise, it was all for nothing.<br><br>Listen, Giovanna, we have to go away.<br><br>Why ?<br><br>Because as long as we stay here, I'll always see him.<br><br>I'll never forget him.<br><br>I still see him behind that counter.<br>I still hear his voice.<br><br>Look, Giovanna,<br><br>let's sell the store and move away--<br><br>away from here.<br><br>If you saw how silly you looked,<br><br>talking so loudly here in the store.<br><br>Somebody will hear you.<br><br>Don't drink so much.<br><br>- Someone's out there.<br>- Let them go.<br><br>We can't. They saw us come in.<br><br>- Then you go.<br>- I can't, dressed like this.<br><br>I'll go upstairs.<br><br>You know what to do. The drinks are all there.<br><br>Open up !<br><br>- Are you closed ?<br>- No. What do you want ?<br><br>I knocked, but didn't see anybody.<br>I'd like something to drink.<br><br>It's hard to work with only one arm.<br><br>- Are you the owner ?<br>- The owner is inside.<br><br>I'm sorry. Sometimes I feel like chatting.<br><br>I'm new around here and I don't know anybody.<br><br>I'm looking for work.<br><br>- How much is it ?<br>- One lira.<br><br>That's cheap. In town, they want 50.<br><br>Pay me whatever you want.<br><br>You must be knew at this.<br><br>You're lucky I'm honest.<br><br>Who was it ?<br><br>Someone looking for work.<br>He was asking questions.<br><br>I don't like people that pry into other people's business.<br><br>I don't like people asking questions.<br><br>What are you afraid of ?<br><br>You're worrying about nothing.<br><br>- What were you doing there ?<br>- Nothing.<br><br>- Let me see ?<br>- What do you care7<br><br>- I want to see.<br>- No.<br><br>- Give it to me, Giovanna.<br>- No, Gino !<br><br>Let go of me.<br><br>Good shot. And on the fly.<br><br>Bregana wouldn't have spent so much money in one evening.<br><br>Of course, he wants to be comfortable.<br><br>Say what you want, they aren't happy.<br><br>Not at all.<br><br>There she is, the lady boss, with Father Remigio.<br><br>Father Remigio is here.<br><br>I stopped to talk with him after mass to ask his opinion,<br><br>then I asked him to come by.<br><br>it was a long time since he last came by to play bocce.<br><br>It wasn't up to me.<br>I had to give up the game.<br><br>Good morning, Costa.<br><br>Have you been drinking again ?<br><br>I have nothing else to do to pass the time.<br><br>Today it's because you have nothing to do.<br><br>Tomorrow it'll be because someone invited you.<br><br>You always have an excuse to get drunk like this.<br><br>Because there is never anything happening.<br><br>Calm down, my dear Costa. You know drinking is bad for you.<br><br>After what happened to poor Bregana...<br><br>It was such a terrible tragedy.<br>We can't get over it.<br><br>Let's not talk about it anymore.<br><br>Peace to his soul.<br><br>Would you like a Strega, Father ?<br><br>No, you don't have to.<br><br>But if it helps to break the ice with this good young man...<br><br>You see, you should put an end to this arrangement of yours.<br><br>That's exactly why I came to see you today.<br><br>Cheers.<br><br>If we-- how would you say-- resolved this situation right away ?<br><br>No, no. Not right away. It would not quiet down the rumors.<br><br>We aren't doing anything wrong.<br><br>Thank you. People always say that.<br><br>But you're hurting yourselves.<br><br>My feeling is that he... could find himself another place.<br><br>Maybe around here.<br><br>I also said from the beginning that it would have been better to go away.<br><br>I'm not afraid of rumors.<br><br>It's not the rumors, Signora Bregana.<br><br>We mustn't forget God and our duties.<br><br>Listen to me. Work alone. Maybe only for a while.<br><br>Perhaps we shouldn't continue talking about this now.<br><br>I'll stop by the church with him in a few days.<br><br>As you wish. But don't forget what I've told you.<br><br>We have to bring this to an end.<br><br>- Good morning.<br>- Here come the musicians.<br><br>- It is the group from Polesella.<br>- Good, very good.<br><br>Take care, then.<br><br>Since they are here, I'll go play some bocce.<br><br>- Good day, Father.<br>- Good day.<br><br>Good day.<br><br>- Would you like a glass of wine ?<br>- Yes, please.<br><br>Who said anything about marriage ?<br><br>Do you think l want to spend my entire life here ?<br><br>You heard. Even the priest says we have to go away.<br><br>Don't talk like this in front of others.<br><br>Do you hear what I'm saying ?<br>I feel like screaming--<br><br>telling everybody what's happening, to put an end to it all.<br><br>You seem afraid to marry me.<br><br>Maybe you don't love me anymore.<br><br>It was only last month<br>when we met in Ancona,<br><br>and you were saying you couldn't live without me.<br><br>That's true...<br><br>but each day I hate this house more.<br><br>We cannot leave now. We'd become destitute.<br><br>Nobody would ever forgive us. We have to stay.<br><br>We have to. Do you understand ?<br><br>I know-- you've always feared uncertainty.<br><br>But you see...<br><br>I was thinking we could sell this place,<br><br>take the money and go anywhere we want.<br><br>Then we could truly start all over.<br><br>Let's wait a while. Not now, I told you.<br><br>How could we leave everything like this, all of a sudden ?<br><br>But I can't handle it.<br><br>I can't get used to it-- sleeping in his bed, eating at his table.<br><br>That's silly.<br><br>We must face people... without fear.<br><br>So that's why you want people here,<br><br>and the music, to get attention.<br><br>What are you thinking ?<br>We have to run the business.<br><br>Take care of it then, if you like parties.<br><br>You've learned how to do so many other jobs, you can learn this one, too.<br><br>This is not a job...<br><br>keeping guard on a dead man's house.<br><br>- Signora Giovanna ?<br>- I'm coming.<br><br>Signora Giovanna ?<br><br>- Signora Giovanna.<br>- I'm coming.<br><br>Good day.<br><br>What can I get you ?<br><br>How did you find me here ?<br><br>What a question. Everybody's talking about you.<br><br>No. Let's go this way.<br><br>What do you do with all your smart ideas ?<br><br>l carry them with me. Why ?<br><br>You had your chance.<br><br>What do you need with them ? You've played your hand.<br><br>You're doing pretty well here.<br><br>You've lost the taste for travel, haven't you ?<br><br>You can't wander around all your life.<br><br>You'll see, sooner or later it'll be the same for you.<br><br>No.<br><br>You should know better. People like me will never stop.<br><br>- Why do you say that ?<br>- You've acted badly, Gino.<br><br>What's wrong with loving a woman ?<br><br>- it's not about the woman.<br>- Then l don't know what you mean.<br><br>You know, Gino, I'm leaving now.<br><br>It's a good time of year.<br><br>I came by thinking maybe you would come with me.<br><br>If it were like before, you would have said yes.<br><br>I wanted to go to Sicily.<br><br>Sicily is beautiful, you know.<br><br>Then again, lots of places are nice-- Naples, Genoa.<br><br>Have you ever been to Genoa ?<br><br>In Genoa you can walk for hours by the docks.<br><br>It's like a main street. You meet a lot of friends,<br><br>because everybody goes to Genoa.<br><br>I know they're building a road. It's easy to find work.<br><br>You'll spend the day blasting your way through the mountains.<br><br>I can't stand it any longer.<br><br>I don't like hanging around anymore.<br><br>What's become of you ?<br><br>I don't like it anymore !<br><br>I don't like to travel anymore.<br><br>And stop playing like you know everything.<br><br>All this talk-- because I don't want to be a bum anymore.<br><br>A bum ? You say that in so harshly.<br><br>I was wrong. I thought I could talk to you like one of us.<br><br>But you don't want to understand. Certain things you pay for.<br><br>- Shut up.<br>- Yes, I'll shut up.<br><br>Don't worry, I'm not going to tell on you.<br><br>- Don't worry.<br>- Shut up !<br><br>Stay here if you want, with that woman you got by--<br><br>Shut up !<br><br>Before, you only threatened me. Now you've got more courage.<br><br>Can I help you ?<br><br>- But you hurt yourself.<br>- Thank you. I'll take care of myself.<br><br>Your temper is too hot, my boy. Punching him right away, even if--<br><br>It's our business.<br><br>I'll walk with you for awhile.<br><br>No, I'll go alone. I don't need anybody.<br><br>Go away, boys. Go on.<br><br>Spagnolo ?<br>Spagnolo... ?<br><br>Spagnolo !<br><br>I'm warning you for your own good.<br><br>He has a hot temper. He punches hard.<br><br>He could be dangerous.<br><br>Signora Giovanna ?<br>Signora Giovanna ?<br><br>I'm coming.<br><br>Hello ?<br><br>How do you do ?<br><br>Signor Giuseppe, you are known as ""Spagnolo"" ?<br><br>Yes, sir.<br><br>Let's go home, it's late.<br><br>We made l80 lire today.<br><br>It was a good idea to hire the musicians.<br><br>Why can't they leave us alone ? It seems everyone knows.<br><br>What are you saying ?<br><br>This time, one year ago... I was in the Apuane Mountains.<br><br>I was working in the mines.<br><br>You talk as if I wasn't here.<br><br>Aren't you going to eat ?<br><br>I'm not hungry.<br><br>What are you doing ? Give me my ball of wool.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>Are the boys misbehaving ? Are they bothering you ?<br><br>No. They just do it for fun.<br><br>Ice cream.<br><br>Ice cream.<br><br>Ice cream for you, sir ?<br><br>- Here you go.<br>- Would you like one, too ?<br><br>Another one.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Ice cream.<br><br>- It's what you need with this heat.<br>- Why are you smiling ?<br><br>No reason, I just feel happy.<br><br>That means you don't have any worries.<br><br>I have worries, all right. Maybe it was meeting you.<br><br>Or maybe it was the ice cream.<br><br>You are a big flirt, aren't you ?<br><br>It depends, if I like someone.<br><br>Then you like me ?<br><br>Why are you asking ? Do you have something in mind ?<br><br>Maybe.<br><br>- Are you from around here ?<br>- No, I'm leaving soon.<br><br>- You're not from Ferrara ?<br>- No.<br><br>Then you'll be going back home.<br><br>I can't go back home.<br><br>Where are you going, then ?<br><br>I'm on tour. I'm a dancer. Next we'll go to Como.<br><br>I'm in the company. I'm in the second row, left side.<br><br>You can come see me, if you want. At Cinema Teatro Verdi.<br><br>You're a great girl.<br><br>I'm glad I met you.<br><br>Keep me company. I'm due back at the theater for rehearsal.<br><br>I can't. I'm waiting for someone.<br><br>Thanks for the ice cream. It was very kind of you.<br><br>There aren't enough people who are very kind.<br><br>Do you like her ?<br><br>The dancers all stay at Number 15 in Via Saraceno.<br><br>There are even better-looking ones.<br><br>Gino ? Gino.<br><br>Do you want to know something ?<br><br>Bregana had a life insurance policy.<br><br>They'll pay me, but they asked a lot of questions.<br><br>At times it was worse than being with the police.<br><br>But everything went all right.<br><br>I'll get 50,000 lire. We can expand the store.<br><br>A life insurance policy ?<br><br>And you got paid money for it ?<br><br>Yes, that's the way these things work.<br><br>What good fortune for you!<br><br>But Gino, the money is yours too.<br><br>What are you thinking ?<br><br>I don't want any of it !<br><br>Why are you telling me this now ?<br><br>How could I have told you before ?<br><br>Before I got the letter.<br><br>Stop playing with me.<br><br>How stupid I was. I didn't understand.<br><br>When we met you wanted to get rid of me.<br><br>Now I know why you didn't want to come away with me.<br><br>It was this money--<br><br>No, Gino. You're not thinking straight.<br><br>I'm not ?<br><br>Now l know that you used me.<br>You needed someone to help you.<br><br>If it had been only for the money, I could have found someone else--<br><br>- With more courage than you !<br>- You don't need any courage.<br><br>- I wouldn't do it again.<br>- Gino!<br><br>I'm sick of you.<br><br>I can't bear to look at you anymore.<br><br>Watch what you say.<br><br>Are you going to blackmail me now ?<br><br>I'll show you I'm capable of leaving you.<br><br>- Gino!<br>- I don't want to see you.<br><br>Is there a girl living here ?<br><br>- Her name is Anita.<br>- Yes. She is out now.<br><br>If you want to wait, that's her room.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Now you behave yourself !<br><br>First you say yes, then no. What do I do now ?<br><br>Go back to Rosina!<br><br>I wasn't expecting you to visit me.<br><br>I was in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by.<br><br>Then that means that you like me.<br><br>I'm glad you came by.<br><br>You're different from other men.<br><br>I don't know why I feel this way.<br><br>Why did you come here ?<br><br>Now I'm going to eat.<br><br>Do you want some ?<br>Are you hungry ?<br><br>Listen, let's eat together. I'll go out and get something.<br><br>Wait. I'm coming with you.<br><br>Where are you going ?<br><br>Now I understand why you were so worried about the insurance money.<br><br>Come.<br><br>Do you think I'm going to leave you with her ?<br><br>- After all I did for you ?<br>- For me ?<br><br>We love each other. That's why we did what we did.<br><br>Enough. She knows nothing about me.<br><br>Are you concerned about her ?<br><br>Gino !<br><br>Quiet ! Don't say anything.<br><br>Listen, Gino, forget about what I said a minute ago.<br><br>It wasn't fair. But I'm at the end of my rope.<br><br>You wanted me, Gino, and now you don't care about me.<br><br>Let's go back home. You'll calm down.<br><br>You'll think straight again. You'll stop treating me like this.<br><br>No. Leave me alone.<br><br>Look out, Gino.<br><br>- Look out ? Why ?<br>- You know.<br><br>I only have to speak up and they'll be after you.<br><br>Your choice. Come with me or...<br><br>Or what ?<br><br>I'm sorry about what happened on the street.<br><br>I've already eaten, but you can make yourself at home.<br><br>I'll tell you who she is.<br><br>I don't need to know.<br><br>- Why are you acting differently now ?<br>- It's not important.<br><br>Do you realize that your delay could impede justice ?<br><br>Superintendent, we have to work.<br><br>One day we work here, another day we go elsewhere.<br><br>Now you called us and we came. We told you all we knew.<br><br>Could you swear you saw both the man and the woman<br><br>climb up the levee as the car was rolling down ?<br><br>Yes, it made an impression.<br><br>I know the road very well and it seemed strange to me.<br><br>We were the first to help, but we had to go.<br><br>Other people came and we felt we couldn't do much more.<br><br>Yes, they already told me they were in a hurry<br><br>because they had to be in Milan before noon.<br><br>All right. Sign here on the report.<br><br>Come over here.<br><br>What about that man, Costa ?<br><br>Don't worry, Superintendent. We kept an eye on him.<br><br>Today he's here in town, but he has a two-way ticket.<br><br>Let's stop him before he goes.<br><br>I want to question him.<br><br>Sure, Superintendent. I'll take care of it.<br><br>I keep hearing it.<br><br>He tried to get up--<br><br>then I saw him...<br><br>fall again.<br><br>She was looking at me...<br><br>looking at me.<br><br>Then I acted...<br><br>without realizing what I was doing.<br><br>She had been so unhappy.<br><br>Tell me...<br><br>- Do you despise me now ?<br>- No.<br><br>To me you are still the same person.<br><br>I'll never be able to be what I was before.<br><br>Now I'm bound to her forever.<br><br>I'm a police officer.<br><br>Coffee.<br><br>Now I understand-- that man. . .<br><br>has been following me for a month.<br><br>He's a policeman. She's reported me.<br><br>I must get out of here no matter what, Anita.<br><br>What can you do ? Think for a moment.<br><br>If you go back to her you'll never be safe again.<br><br>You can help me. Go downstairs.<br><br>There's a man out there. Come, I'll show you.<br><br>Did you see him ?<br><br>Would you be able to recognize him ?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>You must distract him until I get out of here.<br><br>Tell him...<br><br>you saw him looking up here.<br><br>You know who he is looking for.<br>Tell him I left an hour ago.<br><br>Yes, tell him that. ""He was here but left an hour ago"".<br><br>What if he doesn't believe me ?<br><br>What else can we say ?<br><br>I'll tell him I'm angry with you...<br><br>because you didn't pay me.<br><br>I'll go now.<br><br>Giovanna, open the door.<br><br>Open up, Giovanna.<br><br>Open the door, Giovanna.<br><br>Open up !<br><br>Open ! Giovanna !<br><br>Open !<br><br>Here I am.<br><br>Now you can kill me if you like.<br><br>You kept your promise, didn't you ?<br><br>I don't care about anything anymore.<br><br>I know what you're capable of. I'm not afraid.<br><br>- You're not afraid, eh ?<br>- I don't care about anything.<br><br>You're not afraid ?<br>Then why did you report me ?<br><br>It was only a threat.<br><br>It was only to keep you here.<br><br>But now, if you want to go, go.<br><br>I'm not afraid to be alone anymore.<br><br>I always knew that for you I was the same as any other man.<br><br>No, Gino.<br><br>Don't you understand ?<br><br>Don't make up something else.<br><br>You're glad you reported me. They'll catch me,<br><br>and you'll have your revenge, isn't that so ?<br><br>I didn't report you. I felt like doing it...<br><br>when I saw that girl come between us.<br><br>Only because of that-- but I controlled myself.<br><br>I should've known that sooner or later you'd go.<br><br>These last few days I was afraid you'd go.<br><br>You can't bear staying in one place too long !<br><br>I remember...<br><br>the first time you came here.<br><br>You didn't even have socks on your feet.<br><br>I understand why I loved you so much right away--<br><br>and why I hated him so much.<br><br>Now I couldn't hurt you even if I wanted to.<br><br>Not even to stop you from leaving if that's what you want.<br><br>Because...<br><br>now I'm having a baby. It's your baby, Gino.<br><br>What are you saying ?<br><br>Yes. I suspected.<br><br>Now I'm sure.<br><br>I wanted to tell you about this.<br><br>Before, everything was confused,<br><br>but now I see clearly.<br><br>I've thought about it a lot--<br><br>about us, the baby.<br><br>We have taken one life away,<br><br>we can create another one.<br><br>That's why I'm not afraid anymore.<br><br>I have no resentment toward you.<br><br>l know l love you, Gino,<br><br>and I can't hurt you.<br><br>But you, how can you stop from taking it out on me ?<br><br>Now, if you want, you can do it.<br><br>I've told you everything.<br><br>I'm here.<br><br>Do you think I'm a bad man ?<br><br>No.<br><br>Gino !<br><br>Gino !<br><br>I've looked for you all night.<br><br>You're all wet.<br><br>- Did you run ?<br>- Yes, but I don't mind.<br><br>Forgive me, Giovanna.<br><br>It would have been terrible if I'd hurt you.<br><br>This night was liberating for me.<br><br>It's like I've become a new man.<br><br>Before, something was keeping me away from you.<br><br>I had no peace.<br><br>Now I feel certain, Giovanna.<br><br>But we have to leave--<br><br>for good, right away.<br><br>We will go away.<br><br>It was impossible not to go wrong.<br><br>With everything we lived through, we should have left.<br><br>From now on, don't listen to me. You were right.<br><br>Don't say anything more.<br><br>Didn't I say everything has changed now ?<br><br>Gino... ?<br><br>Gino.<br><br>Last night, why did you say I had reported you ?<br><br>I don't know. That man...<br><br>What man ?<br><br>That man at the station. He must still be after me !<br><br>Giovanna ?<br><br>Lean against me. On my shoulder.<br><br>- Are you all right like this ?<br>- Yes, I'm fine.<br><br>You don't know what it's like.<br><br>It's not just having the baby, it's what you feel.<br><br>Soon I'll have a big belly.<br><br>I don't care if I look ugly.<br><br>Just the opposite.

Indecent?<br><br>Do you know the term<br>""Foreign exchange hero""?<br><br>What ""Foreign exchange hero""?<br><br>That's just the term they use<br>to address us.<br><br>People enjoy calling us names.<br><br>As if they know everything about us.<br><br>They're boasting about us.<br>But still, we don't have anything.<br><br>They're taking the money<br>that we give to the country.<br><br>Through the foreign exchange,<br>that I said earlier.<br><br>Talking to me about this is pointless.<br><br>Say it to the people who can only<br>boast about us, like you just said.<br><br>At least I'm saying it to you now.<br>I'm trying to convince you.<br><br>Your job is just as good as any other job.<br><br>Waiwai.<br><br>Hey, Saejun!<br><br>This simple chat is now getting serious.<br><br>So what do you think?<br>About looking for a boyfriend.<br><br>- I'm looking for something else.<br>- Looking for what?<br><br>What do you mean something else?<br><br>Something else what?<br><br>What you said just now.<br><br>- Which one?<br>- Never mind. Come on.<br><br>You are three days late.<br><br>So for this month, you have to pay<br>the installment plus three days fine.<br><br>The total amount is $1,500.<br><br>The minimum wage that will be applied,<br><br>after July 2008 is<br>3,580 Hong Kong dollars.<br><br>It's around four to five million<br>in Indonesian.<br><br>The payment method is with check,<br>cash or transfer to your bank account.<br><br>Mom, nasi goreng.<br><br>I've got to go.<br><br>-Hi, Gandi<br>-Hi, Sar.<br><br>Gandi, have you met Mayang?<br><br>No. Is she new here?<br><br>I've been here for three months,<br>and it's only my second time in this shop.<br><br>Oh, right. I'm Gandi.<br><br>Mayang.<br><br>Gandi, I have to go over here first.<br><br>Gandi, last night<br>Sekar came to see me again.<br><br>Really?<br><br>Have you found out<br>where she is living now?<br><br>Sari.<br><br>- Who is Gandi actually?<br>- Gandi?<br><br>You can say that he's the father<br>of the Indonesian workers in Hong Kong.<br><br>He organizes many events<br>such as entertainment,<br><br>or even something more serious.<br>Like counseling.<br><br>He works at the consulate.<br><br>But since he hangs out in Warung Bude,<br>he became close to us.<br><br>He listens to our stories.<br>We're really close.<br><br>He used to have a wife.<br>But then they separated.<br><br>I think she got jealous of female<br>Indonesian workers who are close to Gandi.<br><br>And who is Sekar?<br>The name that they mentioned?<br><br>Oh, Sekar?<br>She's also an Indonesian worker here.<br><br>But she's been missing for almost a year.<br><br>From what I heard, she's in debt.<br><br>Her work contract has ended,<br>but she can't leave Hong Kong either.<br><br>The place she borrowed the money from<br>got her passport number.<br><br>So it can be said<br>that she's on the alert list.<br><br>She can't leave Hong Kong.<br><br>There's conflicting information<br>going around about her.<br><br>That can be a lesson for you.<br><br>You're still new here.<br>Don't get easily tempted by the luxury.<br><br>Beside, the rule is we don't get a salary<br>for the first seven months.<br><br>What's the matter?<br><br>When will you go back home?<br><br>I'm so nervous.<br><br>- Why are you nervous?<br>- This is my first time going back home.<br><br>From what I heard, the situation<br>at the airport is pretty scary.<br><br>A migrant worker like her would be<br>easy prey in the bus terminal Papat.<br><br>That's why I transferred<br>all the money to my family.<br><br>And I don't bring a lot of money with me.<br><br>That's good.<br><br>That's what we usually do.<br>We all do that too.<br><br>What else do I need to know?<br><br>- The most important thing is...<br>- Hold on.<br><br>Listen to this.<br>At the airport, you will see a huge sign.<br><br>Read it. If it says ""DELAYED"",<br>it means your flight is delayed.<br><br>If it says ""CANCELED"",<br>it means you can't go home.<br><br>You have to come back here.<br><br>- Her English is great.<br>- Yeah. Turns out your English is amazing.<br><br>Of course. With this style, if I don't<br>speak English, that would be a shame.<br><br>I look like Christina Aguilera, don't I?<br><br>Hi, Tuti!<br><br>Hey, Sari.<br><br>Where are you going?<br><br>Who is this? He's handsome.<br><br>Excuse me, I have to go home now.<br><br>Be careful.<br><br>Bye, Sari.<br><br>That's her boyfriend.<br>They usually go to get a room.<br><br>Enjoy your meal.<br><br>Hey, Mey will be<br>coming in to work tomorrow.<br><br>You're not needed anymore.<br><br>- But, boss...<br>- And it's too dangerous<br><br>if I employ you here.<br><br>This restaurant could be shut down<br>if they found out. Keep working.<br><br>Keep working!<br><br>If you don't pay your rent immediately,<br>then you can get out of my place!<br><br>Go away. We can't hire you. It's illegal.<br><br>Go away. Don't bother my business.<br><br>I'd like to send money to Indonesia,<br>3,000 Hong Kong dollars.<br><br>Using Fire Cash, so they can cash the<br>money using an ID card and a PIN number.<br><br>I need your ID card<br>and the recipient's name.<br><br>This is the transfer receipt and the PIN<br>to cash the money in Indonesia.<br><br>Please sign here.<br><br>- Can they take the money out now?<br>- Yes.<br><br>Whatever.<br><br>Gandi.<br><br>- What's up, Mayang?<br>- May I talk to you for a minute?<br><br>- Of course. Talk about what?<br>- But not here.<br><br>Okay. Come on.<br><br>So, Sekar is your little sister?<br><br>I work here so I can find Sekar.<br><br>Yeah. What have you done<br>while working here for three months?<br><br>Let's talk here.<br><br>I went to the apartment<br>where she used to work, many times.<br><br>I went there hoping to see her.<br>But I never met her.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Does Sari knows about this?<br><br>I only talk about this to you now.<br><br>Sari said you're like a father<br>to the Indonesian workers here.<br><br>So I thought you would know Sekar.<br><br>Everybody knows Sekar.<br>And everybody is looking for her.<br><br>Is she that important?<br><br>I don't understand what you mean.<br><br>I've got to go.<br><br>Mayang! Do you have a cellphone?<br><br>Ask Sari to take you to buy a cellphone.<br>And then put the card in.<br><br>That way, we can keep in touch.<br><br>In the meantime, my friends and I here<br>will keep looking for Sekar.<br><br>Gandi, my friends don't need to know<br>that I'm Sekar's sister.<br><br>Why?<br><br>- I've got to go.<br>- Mayang.<br><br>Mayang!<br><br>Mayang! If you trust me,<br>you will have to trust my kids too!<br><br>- I don't want to talk about it anymore!<br>- Whatever! I'm tired of this!<br><br>I don't want to be disturbed.<br><br>You always fight.<br><br>Who cares.<br><br>Smoke?<br><br>Ti.<br><br>Yati.<br><br>The job you offered me, to babysit<br>an old man. Is it still available?<br><br>Damn you. You see I'm troubled like this,<br>but you're still asking about the job?<br><br>But you're like this everyday.<br><br>You fight. You make up.<br>You fight. You make up. Fight again!<br><br>I'm sick of that.<br><br>Come on, Ti.<br><br>Fine. Tomorrow we'll go there.<br><br>- That's better.<br>- Stop smiling.<br><br>Thanks, Ti.<br><br>- You look terrible when you fight.<br>- You look bad too.<br><br>Hey! Don't go that way.<br><br>Jump up there.<br><br>Let's jump up there.<br><br>Good idea. It's good for children.<br><br>Did you fight with anyone today?<br><br>Good boy.<br><br>Keep going. Keep being a good boy.<br><br>We will take you out more often to play.<br><br>Mayang, let's eat together.<br><br>Bon appetit.<br><br>What do you want to eat?<br>I'll get it for you.<br><br>Give him more vegetables.<br><br>- Bye-bye.<br>- Bye-bye.<br><br>Hey. What kind of cellphone do you want?<br><br>Gandi told you about that?<br><br>Come on, get in.<br><br>What?<br><br>There's something I need<br>to talk to you about.<br><br>We'll go over there.<br><br>My sister?<br><br>- Mayang?<br>- Yes. She's looking for you.<br><br>You want to read this?<br><br>Mayang?<br><br>- Is she here?<br>- Yes. She's looking for you.<br><br>That's strange.<br><br>Why? What's so strange about a<br>big sister looking for her little sister?<br><br>If it's Mayang, then it's strange.<br><br>Saejun!<br><br>Why did you fight?<br>If your mom finds out she will scold you!<br><br>After scolding you, she will scold me!<br><br>Don't you know that?<br>How many times do I have to tell you?<br><br>He won't understand any word of that.<br><br>You speak better Cantonese. You tell him!<br><br>Mayang said that you can't fight with<br>others or you will be scolded by your mum.<br><br>They bully me just because<br>I'm shorter than them.<br><br>I hate them!<br><br>He's upset. He's smaller than the others,<br>so his friends look down on him.<br><br>That's the problem.<br><br>Tell Saejun, there's no point being mad<br>at people who underestimate us.<br><br>He has to learn to accept his shortfalls.<br>He has to learn that from now.<br><br>Or he will grow up to bitter,<br>and that's not fun!<br><br>Mayang says you need to accept<br>the reality. Anger doesn't help.<br><br>If you can't accept the reality,<br><br>you will be unhappy<br>for the rest of your life.<br><br>Let's go.<br><br>- Do you have medicated oil here?<br>- There.<br><br>Thank you so much.<br><br>12 HKD, please.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>My Cantonese is not very good.<br><br>We met before, didn't we?<br><br>- Are you from Indonesia?<br>- You can't tell that?<br><br>- Where did we meet?<br>- At Warung Bude.<br><br>- Did we talk?<br>- No, we just passed each other.<br><br>You don't remember?<br><br>I work here. Where are you actually going?<br><br>- I'm on my way home.<br>- Is it near here?<br><br>Not really.<br><br>Then why did you go this way?<br><br>I'm going inside now.<br><br>May I know your name?<br><br>My name is Vincent.<br><br>Mayang.<br><br>People often talk about you<br>in Warung Bude.<br><br>You're Sekar's sister, aren't you?<br><br>Is it necessary for everybody to know?<br>My friends, Vincent.<br><br>- Vincent?<br>- Whoever he is. Is it really necessary?<br><br>The question is<br>how important it is for you to find Sekar.<br><br>- But it doesn't have to...<br>- Listen to me.<br><br>Before you came here<br>and even if you don't come here,<br><br>we will still be looking for Sekar<br>to help her.<br><br>But I told you, nobody needs to know<br>that I'm her sister!<br><br>Mayang, if she knows her sister<br>is looking for her, it will lure her out.<br><br>You don't know how it is<br>between Sekar and I.<br><br>With your attitude like this?<br>I know how it is.<br><br>Mayang, let's go to Warung Bude.<br><br>No. I have to pick up my boss's son.<br><br>Mayang, you still want<br>to see Sekar, right? Am I right?<br><br>You can't keep behaving like this.<br><br>You're upset, confused.<br>You have to stay calm, Mayang. Stay calm.<br><br>Mayang.<br><br>Mayang.<br><br>Gandi, do you want to know the truth?<br><br>I'm not even sure<br>if I want Sekar to come home or not.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>I've given it to you.<br><br>I have already given it to you.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>It's even harder to ship this stuff now.<br><br>I'll see if they still have it in stock.<br><br>Let's talk later, my friend is here.<br>Let me know when it arrives.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Thank you. Bye-bye.<br><br>It's been years since you came here.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>So you've met Sekar's sister?<br><br>- You mean Mayang?<br>- Yes. Mayang.<br><br>It wasn't intentional though.<br><br>Beside, I don't have<br>any bad intentions with her anyway.<br><br>I didn't say you have.<br><br>I never have negative thoughts about you.<br><br>It's you who thinks bad of me.<br><br>I did, yes. But not too often, right?<br><br>Let's eat. Come on.<br><br>Vincent. He used to be<br>Gandi's best friend.<br><br>Even though their occupations<br>are totally different.<br><br>Vincent is a merchant.<br><br>He purchases items here<br>and sells them in Indonesia.<br><br>Sekar borrowed money from Gandi<br>and Gandi denied it.<br><br>She disappeared ever since.<br><br>""You boast about being the one<br>who cares for all Indonesian workers.""<br><br>""But when someone needs your help,<br>you refuse to help.""<br><br>That's what Vincent said<br>when he argued with Gandi in Warung.<br><br>I was there.<br><br>All this happened, more or less.<br><br>It's all because of Sekar.<br><br>What do you mean?<br><br>You don't like your own sister?<br><br>Mayang!<br><br>Mayang!<br><br>Mayang!<br><br>Mayang!<br><br>Where is that kid?<br><br>Mayang!<br><br>My child.<br><br>It's almost dark. Let's go home.<br><br>Your friends are home already.<br>Come on. Okay?<br><br>- Is Dad home already?<br>- Yes.<br><br>I guess I will go home later then.<br><br>When dad is sleeping.<br><br>- Paint it well. Do not miss any spots.<br>- Yes.<br><br>Dad, I'm going to work now.<br><br>-I'm going, Mom<br>-Yes. Take care.<br><br>Working for years in that farm,<br>but what do you get?<br><br>Look at Sekar.<br><br>After only a few months working,<br>she could pay to renovate my house.<br><br>I could buy a refrigerator, buy a scooter<br>in installments and have a goat farm.<br><br>- Right?<br>- Yes.<br><br>I don't want to see you fighting again.<br><br>That should be alright now.<br><br>Okay, Mayang. Thank you.<br><br>Hello?<br><br>Yes, this is Mayang.<br><br>Vincent? Vincent...<br><br>How do you know my number?<br><br>- Catch this.<br>- You've made a mess here.<br><br>I know how to fold a plane too.<br><br>I use the simplest method.<br><br>Madam, Sir.<br><br>Can I go out today?<br><br>Sure, but don't come back too late.<br><br>It's dangerous for a girl<br>to stay outside at night in Hong Kong.<br><br>Not to mention that you are still<br>unfamiliar with the environment, you know?<br><br>I understand.<br><br>Thank you, Madam.<br>Thank you, Sir.<br><br>My paper plane flies really far.<br><br>Hi, Mayang.<br><br>Now everybody knows my number.<br><br>Okay. I apologize.<br><br>I'm sorry if what I know can upset you.<br><br>So you want to meet me just to say that?<br><br>- Of course not. I'd like to talk to you.<br>- Talk about what?<br><br>To talk about Sekar.<br><br>I want to help you to find you sister.<br>And I've talked a lot with Gandi.<br><br>And then what?<br>Gandi wants to make amends for his guilt?<br><br>Or maybe you feel guilty too!<br><br>You two argue and fight while<br>Sekar's life is getting more uncertain!<br><br>I guess you have heard a lot.<br><br>People here enjoy messing with<br>someone else's business. I don't get it!<br><br>But it's not as bad as you think, Mayang.<br><br>We are in a foreign country now.<br><br>And what is most important for us<br>is our fellow Indonesians.<br><br>Why didn't you help Sekar at that time?<br>Why did you blame Gandi instead?<br><br>Fine. I've got to go now.<br><br>What do you want now?<br><br>- I want to go home too.<br>- But this is not the way to your house.<br><br>Sekar never contacts me.<br><br>And she never tells me anything.<br><br>I heard the news about her<br>from someone else.<br><br>So it's not that<br>I didn't want to help her.<br><br>If she came to you to borrow some money,<br>would you help her?<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>Since I was a kid, I was always taught...<br><br>that if I wanted something, I have to<br>work hard to get it, fight for it.<br><br>Instead of borrow from someone else.<br><br>Here's the place I hang out with friends.<br><br>Enough, okay?<br>We don't need to fight again.<br><br>Don't sulk again.<br><br>Look. That's Agus with her new girlfriend.<br><br>- But you won't stop nagging me.<br>- Well, I'm a man.<br><br>- Just go and confront them.<br>- Come on.<br><br>Hurry up.<br><br>- Should I go there?<br>- Yes.<br><br>-You wait here<br>-Okay.<br><br>It will be exciting.<br><br>- Smile now.<br>- But you keep nagging.<br><br>- Agus.<br>- What?<br><br>You still dare to show your face here.<br><br>Do you have money now?<br><br>Is that why you're<br>taking your girlfriend out?<br><br>You have a job now?<br><br>- Watch what you're saying.<br>- Don't just keep quiet you!<br><br>Gus! Don't just stay quiet!<br>When will you pay your debt?<br><br>You have too much debt already.<br>Pay your debt. Gus!<br><br>- Talk to me.<br>- Let's go.<br><br>Just ignore this jealous girl.<br><br>Who are you calling jealous?<br>You just don't know that jerk, Agus.<br><br>You just watch me, Agus.<br><br>If you come again<br>I will make you regret it!<br><br>You can't do that!<br><br>What's the matter?<br><br>- Agus hasn't paid her debt.<br>- That's Tuti.<br><br>We met her at Warung Bude.<br><br>She used to work<br>in the same apartment with Sekar.<br><br>- Tuti.<br>- Hi, Sari. How are you?<br><br>- What's the problem?<br>- Love problems, you know.<br><br>Come on. Don't get upset.<br><br>Tuti, this is Mayang.<br><br>- Mayang.<br>- This is Tuti.<br><br>Let's eat together.<br><br>Maybe she entertains the guests at the bar<br>to get some money.<br><br>- Sekar?<br>- Yes.<br><br>Bar? What bar?<br><br>A bar, quite far from here.<br><br>She got the information<br>about that bar from me.<br><br>I heard about that bar by coincidence.<br><br>But I didn't know Sekar would do that.<br><br>You can ask Gandi if you don't believe me.<br><br>Well, I'm sorry.<br>I didn't mean to get her in trouble.<br><br>Where's that bar?<br><br>You can't go there alone. It's dangerous.<br>People might misunderstand you.<br><br>You want to go there with me?<br><br>I'm too scared to do that.<br><br>What about you Tuti?<br><br>Don't look at me.<br>You better ask Gandi to go with you.<br><br>Menuk.<br><br>I can't. I'm busy.<br><br>I can do that.<br>But why doesn't Mayang ask me herself?<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>Come on, Mayang. Talk.<br><br>So, when do you want to go there?<br><br>Your remaining debt is now $15,700.<br><br>Ever since I first met Sekar,<br>I've never seen her at the same bar.<br><br>So don't get disappointed<br>if you don't see her there, okay?<br><br>I know.<br><br>Gandi, why is he here?<br><br>I asked him to join us. For our safety.<br><br>If you see Sekar,<br>what are you going to do?<br><br>I will take her with me.<br>That will end all the problems.<br><br>I'm tired of this.<br><br>Gandi, let's just go home.<br><br>I don't think Sekar will be here.<br><br>That's Sekar.<br><br>No.<br><br>That's not her.<br><br>-That's Sekar, Mayang<br>-Gandi.<br><br>That's Sekar.<br><br>Sekar.<br><br>Where are you going? Sekar!<br><br>Gandi will be back soon.<br><br>I failed.<br><br>Mom. How are you?<br><br>Not yet.<br><br>Be patient, Mom.<br><br>Mom, don't cry.<br><br>We can't let it happen.<br><br>We all have to help Sekar.<br><br>I wanted to just<br>confront the Super Credit.<br><br>But that's impossible,<br>because they're a legal institution.<br><br>I'm sure many of us<br>have had problems with Super Credit too.<br><br>Anybody want to share?<br>So we can solve the problem together.<br><br>Yes. You.<br><br>It was three years ago.<br><br>I had to sell the rice field<br>that I gave to my dad to pay the debt.<br><br>- Anyone else?<br>- Me.<br><br>Me too.<br>I wanted to go back to my hometown.<br><br>But since they got my passport number,<br>I'm too scared to go back home.<br><br>So I just took any job to make money.<br><br>Anyone else? If not, I will continue.<br><br>I have debt with Super Credit.<br><br>Up to now, I still do.<br><br>Is it a lot?<br><br>I never payed them, not once.<br><br>Yati, you know the interest rate<br>they apply is huge.<br><br>The longer you delay to pay,<br>the more the debt you have.<br><br>You gave the money to Agus, didn't you?<br><br>Enough.<br><br>Yati, everything I told you about Agus,<br>it's for your own good.<br><br>It's not that I can't stand<br>to see you and Agus dating.<br><br>But, it's because I know Agus.<br><br>She will only make you suffer.<br>You got that?<br><br>Yati.<br><br>Don't put off<br>paying your loan for too long.<br><br>We don't want this problem to get<br>protracted like what happened to Sekar.<br><br>Who called? Why don't you<br>pick up the phone?<br><br>Is your boyfriend calling?<br><br>- Hello.<br>- A client is looking for you.<br><br>- Looking for who?<br>- Mayang.<br><br>- What's his name?<br>- Vincent.<br><br>Dad treats us differently.<br><br>To him, I always fail.<br><br>I never got good grades at school.<br><br>The way I look?<br>I'm not attractive for men.<br><br>Sekar is different.<br><br>She's beautiful. She's smart.<br><br>On top of that, she works in Hong Kong.<br><br>She can send money to dad regularly.<br><br>It all makes dad underestimate me<br>even more. The neighbors too.<br><br>And that means you and Sekar<br>don't get along?<br><br>I'm jealous of her.<br><br>She always gets special treatment.<br><br>I hate her!<br><br>But last night,<br><br>to see her willing<br>to do anything for money,<br><br>it made me think.<br><br>How would my dad feel,<br><br>how would my mom feel,<br><br>if they knew what kind of work<br>Sekar is doing here.<br><br>What about how you feel?<br><br>I'm crushed.<br><br>Mayang! That was a good shot.<br><br>Everybody is looking for you now.<br><br>They all worry about you.<br><br>But you didn't tell them<br>that I'm here, did you?<br><br>Well, I didn't. Because I promised you.<br><br>But, don't you want to meet your sister?<br><br>Or is it because of Gandi?<br><br>What can they do to help me?<br><br>You don't miss your sister?<br><br>Finish the chat? Come on, let's go eat.<br><br>What's wrong with you?<br><br>Can't you see I'm having<br>a serious conversation with her?<br><br>Why are you yelling at me?<br><br>Don't come here again!<br>Why don't you just go and eat!<br><br>I brought my own food.<br>You better go and get the food alone!<br><br>Ti! Yati! Yati!<br><br>This is today's salary.<br><br>Boss, starting tomorrow,<br>could you raise my salary?<br><br>No way. It's fixed.<br><br>Even if you quit,<br>tons of people want this job.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>What's up, Mayang?<br><br>Do you know the address of Super Credit?<br><br>Yes. But what do you want with that?<br><br>Nothing. I just want to know.<br><br>Hey, Vincent, come over here.<br><br>- Any new items coming in?<br>- Here.<br><br>I want this one.<br><br>How much?<br><br>2000 HKD.<br><br>1500 HKD. Okay?<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Okay.<br><br>Are you a new customer?<br><br>You have to fill out this form first.<br><br>Here.<br><br>Running out of money too?<br><br>Yes. And you?<br><br>Me too. How can I not?<br>My husband keeps asking me for money.<br><br>Last time, he asked me for money<br>to buy a cellphone.<br><br>And now he wants to buy a scooter<br>in installments.<br><br>He doesn't know how hard I work here<br>to get the money.<br><br>If he dares to cheat on me,<br>I would go berserk.<br><br>What about you?<br><br>You're two weeks late!<br><br>Your fine is even bigger than your loan!<br><br>Do you understand?<br><br>What are you doing here?<br><br>What about you? What are you doing here?<br><br>I just wanted to know the company<br>that has got Sekar in trouble.<br><br>After you know, and then what?<br><br>I don't know.<br>It's none of your business anyway.<br><br>Everybody is meddling too much<br>in this matter.<br><br>These are not working.<br><br>Try it.<br><br>We will open in an hour.<br><br>It's okay. I will just wait.<br><br>Oh, you're the girl<br>who screwed around here yesterday.<br><br>You're not welcome. Go away!<br><br>I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to do it.<br><br>Go away! You're not welcome.<br><br>Can you do me a favor please?<br>Boss, I really need some money.<br><br>I promise you, I won't do it again.<br><br>It's useless. We're not hiring anymore.<br><br>Please.

<br><br>it made you an instant success,<br><br>and up and coming chef, but-<br><br>Unproven.<br><br>Maybe things<br>happened too quickly.<br><br>The last thing we,<br>our publishing house,<br><br>and you want to do is<br>release a debut cookbook<br><br>that's not even ready.<br><br>It'd be better to<br>wait, refine, you know?<br><br>Well, these are healthy recipes.<br><br>Well, it doesn't matter<br>if no one wants to eat them.<br><br>We'll postpone for now.<br><br>Well, wait, you, you're<br>canceling the book?<br><br>No, postpone, until you<br>have time to rethink things.<br><br>What happens if you don't<br>like what I make next?<br><br>Well, then the healthy<br>brownie recipe is<br><br>your one hit wonder.<br><br>There's no shame in that.<br><br>Um, no, I...<br><br>No, I'll, um, I'll start over.<br><br>I'll throw these out completely.<br><br>If you're not happy,<br>then I'm not happy,<br><br>and I know I could make way<br>better recipes than these.<br><br>The book is supposed to<br>go to press in eight weeks<br><br>and we need something<br>at four, and even then,<br><br>we don't know if it'd<br>be ready in time.<br><br>And it'd have to impress<br>the first focus group.<br><br>We did three groups on this<br>one, all of them a waste.<br><br>April, I love your<br>drive and your willingness<br><br>to rework the recipes, but<br>rushing it is not the way.<br><br>But, I mean, the book<br>has already been announced.<br><br>You know, people following<br>me online are expecting it.<br><br>Publishing schedules,<br>they change all the time.<br><br>No, I'll,<br><br>I will have something for the<br>deadline, something wonderful.<br><br>Like what, we have a lot to<br>do to plan for each cookbook.<br><br>We have marketing, store<br>placement, design, style.<br><br>Um, Italian, um, you know,<br><br>but not your Americanized<br>version of spaghetti and pizza,<br><br>real Italian home cooking<br><br>that the American<br>chef can make at home.<br><br>Okay, what about<br>the health factor?<br><br>You know, the substitution,<br>low cal thing,<br><br>that's very important<br>for your potential brand.<br><br>Absolutely, there's lots<br><br>that I can incorporate,<br>health-wise.<br><br>Real Italian, how do<br>you intend to do that?<br><br>Well, I have family<br>in Italy, actually.<br><br>All right then, four weeks.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>After that, we<br>have to fill the gap<br><br>in the publishing schedule.<br><br>Absolutely, no, I,<br><br>I'll be ready, thank you.<br><br>We need to start looking<br>for backups to take her spot.<br><br>So they didn't like your recipe.<br><br>Don't take it so personally.<br><br>It's my career,<br>Mom, it's important.<br><br>Is this a real brownie,<br>or one of those fake ones?<br><br>Healthy, not fake,<br>and you liked it before.<br><br>That was before<br>I knew it had beans<br><br>and strange grains I've<br>never heard of before.<br><br>It's all in your head.<br><br>April's right.<br><br>Shush.<br><br>Can't complain<br>when you don't cook.<br><br>You want to eat, you cook.<br><br>I'll cook, just<br>please, stop bickering.<br><br>Can you make that<br>casserole I like?<br><br>Soufflé, and yes, I can.<br><br>Excellent.<br><br>So what are you gonna do<br>about your book, sweetie?<br><br>Start over, I have to.<br><br>But I don't have much time.<br><br>I was, um, I was<br>thinking I might<br><br>actually go visit<br>Uncle Derek in Italy.<br><br>Derek, why?<br><br>He was always<br>everyone's favorite uncle.<br><br>Well, that's because<br>he never married,<br><br>he never had kids of his own.<br><br>No, it's because I'm thinking<br><br>I might try an Italian angle.<br><br>It might be the only way<br>to save my publishing deal<br><br>at this point, and Italian's<br>known for the fine cuisine,<br><br>so it's perfect.<br><br>That's France.<br><br>No, Italy is too, Dad.<br><br>But the word cuisine<br>comes from France.<br><br>I read it in a book.<br><br>Shush.<br><br>Don't shush me.<br><br>It was honestly the first<br>thing that came to my mind.<br><br>I was desperate.<br><br>Well, okay, then,<br>I'll call Derek.<br><br>Thanks, Mom.<br><br>Uncle Derek, hi.<br><br>April, hi.<br><br>Oh, it's so good to see you.<br><br>Wow, you too.<br><br>What's up with the sign?<br><br>Oh, no, I thought maybe<br>I wouldn't recognize you,<br><br>you know, but you<br>look exactly the same.<br><br>It hasn't been that long.<br><br>It has, come, this<br>way, let me take this.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>This place is amazing.<br><br>Oh, yeah, it's an<br>investment property,<br><br>but it didn't flip the<br>way I thought it would,<br><br>so I'm staying in<br>it until I sell it.<br><br>Nice.<br><br>Wow, this is beautiful.<br><br>Thanks, yeah, yeah, I<br>keep it ready to show.<br><br>Yeah, Mom mentioned that you<br>did something in real estate,<br><br>but I had no idea that<br>you flipped houses.<br><br>Well, I've dabbled in<br>some commercial properties,<br><br>but, yeah, the vacation<br>homes are more my focus now.<br><br>Why Italy?<br><br>Oh, I did one of those<br>study abroad things<br><br>in college years<br>ago and it stuck<br><br>with me how much I<br>loved this place,<br><br>so when I needed<br>a little change,<br><br>it was the perfect solution.<br><br>Anyway, your room's<br>just over here.<br><br>Thought you might like to<br>overlook the pool and the yard.<br><br>Oh, wow.<br><br>Yeah, just down the<br>road there is the beach,<br><br>if that's your thing.<br><br>Oh my gosh, this is perfect.<br><br>Thank you again so<br>much for having me.<br><br>I really do appreciate it.<br><br>No, please, and, you know,<br><br>your mother really<br>didn't explain much<br><br>your reason for the trip.<br><br>Oh, what did she say?<br><br>Uh, something about a cookbook.<br><br>Yep, well, I just, you know,<br><br>I figured Italy would<br>be a great inspiration<br><br>for my recipes, so.<br><br>Oh, yeah, no, I'm<br>sure it will be.<br><br>I think I'm a little<br>out of the loop.<br><br>I didn't know that you were<br>a hotshot chef back home.<br><br>Oh, no, no, no,<br>I'm definitely not.<br><br>I'm more like a<br>trending up and comer,<br><br>but I'm just, I'm still<br>figuring it all out, really.<br><br>Well, uh, rest up, and if<br>you're up a little bit later,<br><br>we can go grab a bite to eat.<br><br>That sounds great.<br><br>Oh, the nap didn't work.<br><br>I guess not, I honestly<br>didn't mean to fall asleep.<br><br>You're supposed to stay<br>awake as long as possible<br><br>to beat jet lag, right?<br><br>I literally have no idea.<br><br>I have yet to figure<br>out for myself how<br><br>to avoid that when I travel.<br><br>Oh, do you get to travel<br>to lots of other places?<br><br>No, mostly just<br>between here and home.<br><br>You've been gone a long time.<br><br>Do you ever think that you<br>might move back to the US?<br><br>Yeah, I'm sure I will<br>at some point, I mean,<br><br>but right now, this is<br>my work and my life.<br><br>It's good for me.<br><br>So, um, how's your Italian?<br><br>Do you think you could<br>translate this for me?<br><br>I'm having a little<br>trouble here.<br><br>Wait a minute, I thought<br>all chefs knew Italian.<br><br>Oh, only ""al dente,""<br>and I don't think<br><br>that's gonna help me in<br>this situation.<br><br>Okay, come on.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>So, uh, your ""pollo,""<br>that's chicken.<br><br>And you got your ""pesce,""<br>that's your fish.<br><br>Pasta, that's-<br><br>Got it, thanks.<br><br>And I would go<br>with this one here,<br><br>first timer recommendation.<br><br>Okay, that's what I'll get.<br><br>So what are your<br>plans while you're here?<br><br>I mean, I can take you<br>around and do the tour<br><br>of all the must-sees.<br><br>Oh, no, I'm sure you're busy.<br><br>I'm just gonna explore, you<br>know, try the local cuisine.<br><br>Actually, I was hoping I<br>could cook up some stuff<br><br>in your kitchen<br>if you don't mind.<br><br>Oh, no, not at all.<br><br>Oh, have you looked into these<br>culinary tours they have?<br><br>They've got a bunch of<br>them here regionally,<br><br>in fact, throughout<br>the whole country.<br><br>No, what is that,<br>exactly, like a guide<br><br>that takes you to restaurants?<br><br>Yes, but also,<br>you know, to farms<br><br>and vineyards and<br>sources for the food,<br><br>you know, and they try to<br>target all the best ones.<br><br>It usually ends up being<br>what the tourists like,<br><br>but they're really,<br>really popular.<br><br>Hmm.<br><br>Okay, ""experience the best foods<br><br>and where they come<br>from in beautiful Italy.<br><br>This three day tour<br>includes unique tastes<br><br>from charming eateries<br>and a perspective<br><br>of delectable food sources<br>you don't want to miss.""<br><br>All right, why not?<br><br>Excuse me,

experience.<br><br>Okay, you have any<br>questions, you ask me, no?<br><br>Have a breakfast, most<br>important meal of the day.<br><br>Today, we visit the source of<br>the most important ingredient<br><br>in Italiano cooking.<br><br>Which is?<br><br>Olive.<br><br>Of course.<br><br>Olive oil, we use it,<br>but do we appreciate it?<br><br>I say no.<br><br>Who do we have with us today?<br><br>Stephanie and Ryan?<br><br>Tyson and Joy?<br><br>And April.<br><br>That's me.<br><br>All Americanos.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Come on, we eat in the van.<br><br>Where is everyone from?<br><br>Indiana.<br><br>Florida.<br><br>April, what about you?<br><br>New York.<br><br>Ah, of course.<br><br>The olive is the<br>best fruit, yeah.<br><br>I say fruit, that<br>it grows on a tree.<br><br>We eat them plain, in a salad,<br><br>in a pizza, in a<br>pasta, even in a drink,<br><br>and for everything else,<br>there is olive oil.<br><br>Come, we explore more.<br><br>With over 500 types<br>of olive trees,<br><br>Italia is the second<br>largest producer<br><br>of the olive in the world.<br><br>Right now, the<br>olive is small, see?<br><br>But in the fall, when<br>it is time to harvest,<br><br>it will be big and<br>ready to enjoy.<br><br>What kind of weather<br>can they stand?<br><br>Excellent question, olive<br>tree needs lots of heat,<br><br>lots of sun.<br><br>Cold weather can harm the tree.<br><br>What about diseases?<br><br>Why do you ask, you want<br><br>to plant an olive<br>tree in your home?<br><br>Just kidding, as you say.<br><br>Okay, the biggest<br>threat of disease<br><br>and, as you say, pests,<br>is to the flavor.<br><br>Come, we do some tasting.<br><br>Now that you have<br>seen the trees,<br><br>who wants to sample a<br>true Italiana olive oil?<br><br>There are many<br>flavors to choose from<br><br>that they make right<br>here in the factory,<br><br>all from the orchard<br>you're just in, come, try.<br><br>Ah.<br><br>Try them all.<br><br>Mm, this is amazing.<br><br>Here, I take a photo for you.<br><br>Oh, no, that's okay.<br><br>Come, let me, come.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Now you have something to<br>remember your vacation.<br><br>Oh, I'm actually<br>here for work, so.<br><br>What works brings you to Italia?<br><br>Cooking, actually, yeah.<br><br>I post my recipes online.<br><br>And this is work?<br><br>Hey, Roberto, do you<br>mind taking a photo for us?<br><br>You bet.<br><br>Okay, here.<br><br>Oh, trade.<br><br>Yeah, yeah.<br><br>Okay, say, ""Olive.""<br><br>- Olive.<br>- Olive.<br><br>April Meyer, ""Try my<br>healthy brownie recipe.""<br><br>Is this you?<br><br>You looked up my profile.<br><br>We have internet.<br><br>But a healthy brownie, though?<br><br>Yeah, it's really good.<br><br>So it says in all the comments.<br><br>It looks like<br><br>you are quite the online<br>cooking celebrity, no?<br><br>No.<br><br>Well, I am honored<br>to have you on my tour.<br><br>So you come to learn<br>to cook Italiana?<br><br>No, I know how to cook Italian<br>food, I'm just here to, um-<br><br>You try to make it<br>healthy, like your brownie?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Ah, I think it's<br>smart, you know,<br><br>the Americanos can learn a<br>lot from great Italiano chefs.<br><br>But healthy food, I<br>myself am not a fan.<br><br>I like food that tastes good.<br><br>But don't sweat it,<br><br>I won't tell anybody<br>you are here to learn.<br><br>""Not a fan,"" ""don't sweat it""?<br><br>If anybody is hungry,<br>we have snacks inside.<br><br>Ooh, yes, I'm starving.<br><br>Roberto, where are you from?<br><br>From this little village outside<br><br>of where we started the tour.<br><br>Right, and you're<br>originally from there?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Are you even Italian?<br><br>Of course.<br><br>I mean, ""Don't sweat it,""<br>that's such an American thing<br><br>to say, and your accent,<br>it's a little, I don't know.<br><br>Okay, hey, okay, fine.<br><br>I'm an American.<br><br>I knew it.<br><br>Is your name even Roberto?<br><br>Yeah, Robert Cowley,<br>but I go by Rob.<br><br>Wow, okay, well,<br>why are you lying?<br><br>I'm not lying, I'm<br>just doing my job, okay?<br><br>I have no credibility<br>doing this as an American.<br><br>I mean, it's kind of a bait<br>and switch, don't you think?<br><br>Come learn the beautiful<br>flavors of Italy<br><br>from a born and bred American.<br><br>It works for the tourists.<br><br>I mean, you were just<br>giving me a hard time<br><br>about learning from<br>great Italian chefs,<br><br>and you're not even<br>Italian yourself.<br><br>Well, I am a chef.<br><br>Oh, yeah, where do you cook?<br><br>At a restaurant.<br><br>Which one?<br><br>I'm working on that.<br><br>Mm-hmm.<br><br>Well, not all of us<br>can have instant success<br><br>because we posted<br>something on social media.<br><br>Well, I mean, it was-<br><br>Hey, my wife was wondering<br>where the bathroom is.<br><br>Yeah, it's just through<br>the gift shop in the back.<br><br>Okay, cool, thanks.<br><br>Wait, what happened<br>to your accent?<br><br>It's a good question.<br><br>All right, right this way,<br>everybody come inside.<br><br>Mm, the carbs.<br><br>I know.<br><br>Babe, how many of<br>these can we buy?<br><br>All right, now, we all know<br>the French have their bread.<br><br>Does anybody want<br>to take a guess<br><br>at what makes the<br>Italian bread so amazing?<br><br>The herbs?<br><br>Close, the olive oil,<br><br>see how this is all brought<br>back together today?<br><br>Now, the herbs are key, too.<br><br>They actually rest<br>in the olive oil,<br><br>marinating in that<br>sauce to bring<br><br>about that amazing<br>flavor in the bread.<br><br>Now, our gracious<br>host, Octavio here,<br><br>is gonna show us how to<br>make a mean Focaccia.<br><br>Let's all head to the kitchen.<br><br>Hey.<br><br>Hey.<br><br>The whole Italian<br>accent thing, I'm,<br><br>I'm really sorry, I feel bad.<br><br>Well, it's-<br><br>You know, I shouldn't have<br>ruined it for the others.<br><br>Well, it's all right.<br><br>Let's just hope they don't<br>stiff me on tips now.<br><br>If it wasn't for<br>all the American things<br><br>you were saying, I probably<br>wouldn't have picked up on it.<br><br>Oh, yeah?<br><br>And the accent was a<br>little iffy.<br><br>Well, you're the first<br>one to say something.<br><br>Should I be proud of that?<br><br>Maybe, let's hope the others<br>aren't as clever as you are.<br><br>Guess it's hard to hide<br>who you really are.<br><br>Or, I mean, for what it's worth,<br><br>I prefer Rob more than Roberto.<br><br>Why is that, 'cause you feel<br><br>I'm more relatable<br>as an American?<br><br>Maybe, but more like<br>it's the real you.<br><br>Hmm.<br><br>Mm, rosemary,<br><br>garlic.<br><br>Maybe I can try a<br>different flour.<br><br>Ooh, smells good.<br><br>Oh, hey, I'm<br>testing the recipes.<br><br>Oh, you need a sampler,<br>'cause I am great at that.<br><br>I do, actually.<br><br>Excellent.<br><br>Wow, that is amazing.<br><br>Oh, yeah, that's the one<br>I bought on tour today.<br><br>It's not the healthiest.<br><br>Here, try mine.<br><br>Okay, thank you.<br><br>Welcome.<br><br>And how was the tour?<br><br>You know, it<br>was actually pretty good.<br><br>Yeah, anything interesting?<br><br>Well, the olive tree<br>farm was pretty cool,<br><br>but, you know, olive oil<br>has a lot of calories,<br><br>so I'm trying to find<br>a way to cut them out.<br><br>Mm-hmm.<br><br>Is that why you chose to go<br><br>with the straight<br>vinegar instead?<br><br>Yeah, what do you<br>think, did it work?<br><br>I think it may<br>be a little strong.<br><br>Okay, well, what<br>about the bread?<br><br>It's interesting, what's in it?<br><br>Well, I put some wheat flour,<br><br>and then I saw you<br>had some brown rice,<br><br>so I ground that up and<br>put that in there, too,<br><br>and then, you know,<br>a little bit of this,<br><br>a little bit of that, so.<br><br>Culinary secrets.<br><br>It's a little dense.<br><br>Yeah, maybe that's it.<br><br>You know what, most healthy<br>things are, it's just,<br><br>I gotta find a way to<br>make it a little more-<br><br>Yeah, yeah.<br><br>Have you had dinner, 'cause<br>I can cook you up something.<br><br>No, no, I couldn't ask that.<br><br>But you're letting me stay here.<br><br>I mean, it's the last I can do.<br><br>No, I had a late<br>lunch, but a rain check?<br><br>Sure.<br><br>Yeah, I'm gonna.<br><br>Hmm, mm-mm, that's not good.<br><br>Okay, who knows what<br>makes bad fish bad?<br><br>Oh, I don't eat fish.<br><br>Okay, what makes good fish good?<br><br>Freshness.<br><br>Very good, and Italy<br>is a coastal country<br><br>with the best fish, come<br>here, I'm gonna show you.<br><br>Ooh, um, can I<br>have one of those?<br><br>You know, it seems to me that<br>half this tour is getting us<br><br>to shell out money<br>at selected shops.<br><br>Do I look like I'm forcing<br>them to buy anything?<br><br>Well, you know the fish is<br>gonna stink up the van the rest<br><br>of the day, right?<br><br>I got a cooler in the back.<br><br>Come on, it's not my first tour.<br><br>Why do you do<br>these tours, anyways?<br><br>Why not?<br><br>Well, I'm just<br>saying, you're a chef,<br><br>you know, most<br>chefs I know cook.<br><br>Yeah, well, I<br>found transitioning<br><br>to running a kitchen is<br>a little more difficult<br><br>than I thought.<br><br>And I really want to<br>be the creative force<br><br>behind the foods I make someday.<br><br>So until then?<br><br>Until then, culinary<br>tours pay the bills.<br><br>Plus, it really puts me in<br>touch with some great chefs.<br><br>Oh, do you mind if I?<br><br>No, not at all.<br><br>Can I take one of those?<br><br>Everything okay?<br><br>Yeah, opportunity.<br><br>All right, everybody,<br><br>we've got reservations<br>just down the road here.<br><br>Joy, I'm not sure if they<br>have a children's menu,<br><br>but they serve more<br>than just fish.<br><br>Ha ha.<br><br>Hey, so.<br><br>Wow, that looks authentic.<br><br>Thank you, one sec, before<br>we eat, I'm just gonna.<br><br>Perfect.<br><br>Wow.<br><br>And I have a fish stew, as well.<br><br>Really good, boy, wow.<br><br>There you go.<br><br>I'll fix you a plate.<br><br>You know, I just,<br><br>I don't know why the fish<br>stew didn't turn out.<br><br>Well, honestly,<br>with a name like that,<br><br>did it stand a chance?<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>It's okay, it does sound<br>kind of gross, doesn't it?<br><br>Well, I think really,<br><br>it was probably just<br>the green stuff.<br><br>Yeah, well, was it the kale<br><br>or the Brussels<br>sprouts that ruined it?<br><br>Oh, that's what those were?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>I'm gonna guess both.<br><br>You know, I was<br>gonna add potatoes,<br><br>but that's too much starch,<br>so this was healthier.<br><br>Well, you know what?<br><br>The baked fish was excellent.<br><br>Thanks, I mean,<br><br>it's kind of hard<br>to mess that up.<br><br>So who are you trying<br>to show you can cook?<br><br>My publishers, yeah, they,<br><br>they didn't like my<br>first round of recipes,<br><br>them along with three<br>focus groups of people, so.<br><br>Oh, honey, I'm sorry.<br><br>No, it's okay, I just,<br>I have to start over.<br><br>It's just really hard to make<br>things healthy all the time.<br><br>Yeah, I thought<br>nowadays healthy meant,<br><br>you know, less processed<br>and more real ingredients.<br><br>No, it does, it's just,<br>I kind of got pigeonholed<br><br>into this brand my publishers<br>are trying to create<br><br>for me that's all about cutting<br>calories and fats, and just-<br><br>While still tasting good.<br><br>Exactly, which is clearly<br>the hard part for me.<br><br>Well, again, I think, for me,<br><br>the baked fish is a home run.<br><br>Yeah? Thanks.<br><br>At least I got one thing<br>right, right?<br><br>And hey, I'm actually gonna<br>make one of my breakfast bars<br><br>for tomorrow morning,<br><br>do you want me to<br>leave one out for you?<br><br>- Uh, sure, yeah.<br>- Okay, great.<br><br>Your ideas are good.<br><br>Sylvia says you are a great<br>cook, and so does Giovanna.<br><br>I tasted your food, it's good.<br><br>But how does it look if I hire<br><br>an Americano to be my<br>chef in Italy, hmm?<br><br>It says you want the best food,<br><br>no matter where it comes from.<br><br>Good excuse, but my<br>customers are Italiano, no?<br><br>They might be upset.<br><br>Well, I'll be<br>back in the kitchen,<br><br>too busy cooking for<br>anyone to ever notice.<br><br>People talk, Roberto.<br><br>So let them talk, as long<br>as the food is excellent,<br><br>which it will be, then<br>nothing else matters.<br><br>I mean, ultimately, that's<br>all they'll be talking about.<br><br>I think no.<br><br>But I wish you luck.<br><br>Please, just give me a chance.<br><br>You won't regret it, I promise.<br><br>We can even try it for<br>a week, just to start.<br><br>Last day.<br><br>Yeah, but I left the fish<br>in our kitchen out last night<br><br>and it smelled<br>rotten this morning.<br><br>It was so bad.<br><br>It was so, so-<br><br>Hey, guys.<br><br>Morning.<br><br>Good morning, how are you?<br><br>Good.<br><br>Hey.<br><br>Morning.<br><br>Hi.<br><br>Is everything all right?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>What are you eating?<br><br>Oh, it's a breakfast bar,<br>it's one of my recipes.<br><br>- Oh.<br>- Do you,<br><br>do you want to try?<br><br>Yeah, thanks.<br><br>What do you think?<br><br>I think you're<br>missing something.<br><br>Oh, what?<br><br>Hmm, butter, let me<br>show you how to use it.<br><br>I know how to use butter.<br><br>Here.<br><br>Oh, no, thanks, I<br>already ate breakfast.<br><br>That's not what<br>that was, come on.<br><br>It's the last day of your<br>tour, you gotta try it.<br><br>Well, what is it?<br><br>An Italian pastry.<br><br>Oh, thanks, I know that much.<br><br>Filled with peach<br>and fig filling.<br><br>All right.<br><br>So, what do you think?<br><br>You're right, it's pretty good.<br><br>Uh-huh.<br><br>You happy?<br><br>Yeah, I am, it's my recipe.<br><br>Really, why is something<br>you made being sold here?<br><br>Is this your bakery<br>or something?<br><br>No, I used to work here.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>I used to tinker around<br>with some of the staples<br><br>and I came up with this<br>variation of the filling.<br><br>Well, it's very unique.<br><br>Not healthy, by any means.<br><br>I'm just saying it's, you<br>can taste the butter in it.<br><br>Why you always gotta go<br>with the healthy thing?<br><br>'Cause being<br>healthy is important.<br><br>Well, yeah, sure, I get that.<br><br>It is important to be healthy.<br><br>It's also important<br>to enjoy life.<br><br>Why do you have to be<br>so obsessed with that?<br><br>All right, everybody, this is<br>Giovanna, the baking goddess.<br><br>She's creating some<br>serious magic over here.<br><br>You gotta try it, but<br>don't eat too much<br><br>because we got a whole lot<br>more to eat and see today.<br><br>No culinary tour is<br>complete without pizza<br><br>as it's truly meant to be,<br><br>none of those American<br>imitations, right?<br><br>Now, Davide here-<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Is gonna tell us all about<br>what makes pizza Italian.<br><br>Siì, well, for me, it all<br>starts with the sauce, hmm?<br><br>Not out of a can.<br><br>Okay, now, you can make<br>the pizza with the sauce.<br><br>You can make the pizza<br>without the sauce.<br><br>You can have a red sauce,<br>Alfredo sauce, you pick,<br><br>but for me, my favorite,<br><br>tomato, huh, simple, no?<br><br>Listen.<br><br>This is made fresh one hour ago<br><br>with tomatoes that were picked<br>yesterday, huh?<br><br>Welcome, my friends, to Italy.<br><br>You okay?<br><br>Uh-huh.<br><br>Okay, now, remember,<br>don't put the cheese<br><br>on until after your<br>pizza is cooked mostly.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Nice job, that looks good.<br><br>Hey.<br><br>You happy, I'm using olive oil.<br><br>Yeah, I'm actually<br>surprised you haven't used<br><br>so many veggies that<br>you can't see the dough.<br><br>Well, I was gonna chop up<br>spinach and put in the dough,<br><br>but I didn't want to<br>offend Davide, so.<br><br>That's a good idea.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Hey, um, I'm sorry<br>about what I said earlier,<br><br>you know, the whole<br>healthy thing.<br><br>Oh, no, it's okay,<br>you were being honest.<br><br>I won't hold it against you.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>You know, the,<br><br>the reason why I focus<br>on healthy so much is<br><br>because I had this<br>faux brownie recipe<br><br>that was a big hit.<br><br>Faux, like, as in fake?<br><br>I use healthy substitutes.<br><br>That's what I don't understand.<br><br>What's wrong with real?<br><br>No, there's nothing<br>wrong with it, it's just,<br><br>well, it's just, it's kind<br>of what I'm known for now.<br><br>What's with the diary?<br><br>It's not a diary,<br>it's, um, it's for notes<br><br>for the recipes.<br><br>For your followers?<br><br>Actually, it's for a cookbook.<br><br>I've got a deadline coming up,<br><br>so I'm just trying to come<br>up with some fresh ideas.<br><br>A cookbook?<br><br>Mm-hmm.<br><br>That's great.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>You know, it's gonna<br>take more than olive oil,<br><br>fish, and pizza to have<br>true Italian inspiration.<br><br>I know, I know,<br>I'm gonna, you know,<br><br>keep exploring<br>the local cuisine,<br><br>see if I can come up<br>with fresh recipes.<br><br>You know, I could<br>show you some things,<br><br>some things that you<br>really shouldn't miss.<br><br>Really?<br><br>Mm-hmm.<br><br>Well, I thought this tour<br>was everything I needed.<br><br>It is for the average tourist,<br><br>but not for a breakthrough chef.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Well, I mean,<br><br>don't you have your job?<br><br>Yeah, I've got a<br>tour here and there,<br><br>but I could fit it in.<br><br>Well, that's really nice of you.<br><br>And why would you want<br>to help me, though?<br><br>I had your breakfast bar.<br><br>And it's nice to be able<br>to talk to another chef.<br><br>Well, it's up to you.<br><br>Well, yeah, um,<br><br>I'd like that.<br><br>Great.<br><br>Great.<br><br>You know, I really<br>should take you<br><br>to see some of the<br>sites around here,<br><br>but I figured you could use<br>something a little more peaceful<br><br>and close by today.<br><br>No, this is great.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Do you come up here often?<br><br>You know, yeah, I<br>really prefer the view<br><br>from up here rather<br>than, you know,<br><br>right down there by the beach.<br><br>Oh, really,<br><br>do you not like the<br>ocean or something?<br><br>No, I don't.<br><br>And don't say<br>anything to your mom.<br><br>She teased me<br>mercilessly growing up.<br><br>I heard, so what is it,<br>is it sharks, jellyfish?<br><br>Yes, all of the above.<br><br>Well, you're missing out.<br><br>Ah, well.<br><br>So how is your<br>mom doing, anyway?<br><br>She's great, why do you ask?<br><br>Um, I just got<br>the sense that she<br><br>and your dad, you know,<br>don't really get along.<br><br>Oh, yeah, they definitely<br>bicker a lot, so.<br><br>Sometimes I just feel like<br>they stir stuff up out<br><br>of nothing, it's weird.<br><br>Hmm, that must have<br>been hard to see.<br><br>Yeah, but I know that they<br>love each other, you know,<br><br>they just have a really<br>argumentative way of showing it.<br><br>That's the not the reason<br>why you never, you know-<br><br>Why I never got married?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>No, no, no, yeah.<br><br>I know the family<br>has their theories,<br><br>but I can assure you your mother<br><br>and her marriage did<br>not scare me off.<br><br>Of course.<br><br>No, no, I'm in the<br>loved and lost category.<br><br>Really?<br><br>What happened?<br><br>Oh, no, nothing<br>tragic, yeah, no.<br><br>I just, uh, I just<br>kind of missed out<br><br>on my chance years ago, yeah.<br><br>Things were great,<br>and I got scared.<br><br>I let her go.<br><br>And when I finally figured out<br><br>that that was stupid,<br>um, it was too late.<br><br>She had moved on.<br><br>Is that one of the reasons<br>why you came out here, or?<br><br>Yes, partly, but don't<br>say anything to the family.<br><br>I really like<br>hearing the rumors.<br><br>Well, she must have<br>been really special.<br><br>Yeah, she was, you know,<br>but she's happily married now<br><br>with the kids and the house<br><br>and career, et<br>cetera, et cetera.<br><br>And no one since then has?<br><br>No, no.<br><br>I mean, I admit I'm<br>okay with just missing<br><br>what could have been.<br><br>I have my work,<br>it keeps me busy,<br><br>and, you know, I<br>prefer it that way.<br><br>Oh, have you had any,<br>you know, potential buyers,<br><br>any interest in the house?<br><br>Oh, yeah, some, yeah, we'll see.<br><br>You know, I could<br>actually bake cookies,<br><br>the house smells good<br>when people come in,<br><br>and then I promise I will<br><br>just put regular cookie<br>ingredients in, nothing weird.<br><br>Thank you, yes, I'll<br>let you know, yeah.<br><br>Oh, so tell me a little bit<br>about the culinary tour thing.<br><br>Did that work out for you?<br><br>Yeah, it was great, actually.<br><br>The guy had offered<br>to take me around<br><br>and see other must-sees<br>in the area, so.<br><br>Oh, that was very nice of him.<br><br>Yeah, it was, actually.<br><br>Hello?<br><br>April, William here.<br><br>So how's that new and improved<br>cookbook coming along?<br><br>Hi, um, yeah, it's going great.<br><br>Glad to hear it, so you<br>on track for the deadline?<br><br>Yes, yes, I will be.<br><br>Actually, um, since I have you,<br><br>I just wanted to run something<br>by you, see what you thought.<br><br>Mm-hmm?<br><br>Instead of me focusing<br>on the low calorie<br><br>and low fat type of healthy,<br>I was just wondering<br><br>if I, if I switched<br>to just natural foods.<br><br>What's the difference?<br><br>Well, it would be<br>playing up beautiful,<br><br>flavorful foods,<br>nothing processed, with real ingredients,<br><br>and even if it means being a<br>little bit less diet friendly.<br><br>Hmm, I don't know.<br><br>It's okay, it<br>was just a thought.<br><br>You know what, I'll<br>run it by marketing<br><br>and I'll get back<br>to you, all right?<br><br>Okay, sure.<br><br>Okay, but keep at it, though.<br><br>I will.<br><br>Good morning.<br><br>Buongiorno, Roberto.<br><br>Are you hungry?<br><br>I'm starved, where are we going?<br><br>Oh, you'll see.<br><br>Well, what is this place?<br><br>Oh, it's a stop I make on<br>some of my other culinary tours.<br><br>Aw, that is a lot of geese.<br><br>I know, right?<br><br>Yeah, they have a lot of<br>their own animals here.<br><br>They make jams and jellies and<br>different kinds of cheeses,<br><br>- stuff like that.<br>- Oh, yeah?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Cool.<br><br>Oh, do you mind if I take this?<br><br>Oh, no, not at all.<br><br>Is everything all right?<br><br>Yeah, yeah.<br><br>Are you sure?<br><br>Yeah, it's just a job<br>interview that I didn't get.<br><br>Oh, I'm sorry, what was the job?<br><br>A chef in my neighborhood<br>restaurant, so it's...<br><br>Anyway, do you want to eat?<br><br>Yeah, I'm sorry.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Wow, this is a lot of food<br>for one charcuterie board.<br><br>Yeah, you know, in Italy,<br>it's actually called ""salumi.""<br><br>Oh, I didn't know that.<br><br>There's a lot of<br>great cheeses here.<br><br>Do you have a favorite?<br><br>You're gonna laugh.<br><br>No, I won't.<br><br>Mozzarella, I know, it's the<br>most basic and bland cheese.<br><br>Yeah, well, it's<br>also an Italian staple.<br><br>You really shouldn't<br>be ashamed about that.<br><br>But you've tried<br>the others, right?<br><br>Oh, yeah, of course, I just-<br><br>Of course.<br><br>I'm... I don't know,<br><br>I really love the<br>simplicity of Mozzarella.<br><br>Yeah, I mean, in the right<br>combinations, it's perfect.<br><br>But in the name of research<br>and your culinary quest,<br><br>you've gotta try everything.<br><br>I never turn down cheese,<br><br>so don't worry about that.<br><br>Wow, that is amazing.<br><br>Right?<br><br>It's so good.<br><br>Hold on, before we<br>eat, I'm going to...<br><br>Yes, this just screams<br>delicious, oh my goodness.<br><br>What do you think it is<br>that makes it taste so good?<br><br>The flavors and the-<br><br>Go further.<br><br>The sweetness of<br>the honey paired<br><br>with the spiciness of<br>the meats and cheese,<br><br>it's, well, it's a lot of<br>flavor for one slab of wood.<br><br>Yeah, yeah, it is.<br><br>Hold on.<br><br>Here, what do you think?<br><br>""The combination of<br>bold flavors brings<br><br>out the best experience<br><br>for your palette,<br>#salumirules,"" I like it.<br><br>Posting it right now.<br><br>You know, I figure<br>if I keep this up,<br><br>I can appease my publishers<br><br>so they won't give<br>me a hard time about,<br><br>you know, nutrition and<br>fat content and all that.<br><br>Are they really that picky?<br><br>Yeah, they're just,<br><br>they're convinced I don't<br>know what I'm doing.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>No, it's fine, I just, I<br>have to prove them wrong.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Shall we?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Where do we begin?<br><br>So what is it you<br>like about cooking?<br><br>Other than the food?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Well, I, I love how it<br>brings people together.<br><br>You mean like for special<br>occasions and stuff?<br><br>Yeah, but, you know, also<br>just for the every day.<br><br>You know, like when<br>I was growing up,<br><br>my parents, they<br>fought all the time.<br><br>They still do, to be<br>honest, but, I don't know,<br><br>when we sat down and we had<br>a good meal, there was peace.<br><br>That's nice.<br><br>Yeah, what about you?<br><br>Cooking was kind of always<br>a source of contention.<br><br>Oh, what?<br><br>Hey, what do you think<br>about these leftovers?<br><br>Should we test your<br>culinary skills?<br><br>Well, what about<br>your culinary skills?<br><br>Oh, is that a challenge?<br><br>Maybe.<br><br>Challenge accepted.<br><br>So this is your uncle's place?<br><br>Oh, yeah, um, but it's<br>his investment property.<br><br>He's trying to sell it.<br><br>It's amazing, I'd buy<br>it if I could afford it.<br><br>Yeah, me too.<br><br>So what are you making?<br><br>Oh, I'm using<br>the cheese and meat<br><br>from the charcuterie<br>board and making a pasta.<br><br>Oh, very nice.<br><br>And what about you?<br><br>Flatbread, not to be<br>confused with pizza.<br><br>Very original.<br><br>Oh, come on,<br>you're making pasta.<br><br>Yeah, you're right.<br><br>Is this your recipe book?<br><br>Oh, yeah, yeah.<br><br>Huh, it's cool.<br><br>Wow, some of these ingredients<br>don't normally go together.<br><br>Let me guess, the healthy ones.<br><br>Well, not all,<br><br>but it looks like they might<br>take away from the flavor.<br><br>Oh, thanks.<br><br>Well, do you like any of these?<br><br>Um, yeah, I mean,<br><br>there's a couple I like.<br><br>Well, why not just<br>make whatever you want?<br><br>I wish it were that simple.<br><br>Hello.<br><br>Hey, oh, um, this is Rob.<br><br>I was telling you about<br>him from the culinary tour.<br><br>Yeah, hi, Rob, I'm Derek.<br><br>Nice to meet you,<br>Derek, sorry to intrude.<br><br>No, no, happy to have you.<br><br>Boy, it smells good,<br>something's cooking, huh?<br><br>Oh, two things are<br>cooking, actually,<br><br>and you have to try both of them<br><br>and tell us which<br>one you like better.<br><br>I can do that.<br><br>Oh, is that how it's gonna be?<br><br>It is.<br><br>All right.<br><br>Okay, I'm gonna start<br>with the flatbread.<br><br>Yeah?<br><br>Mm, mm, mm, really good.<br><br>Okay, okay, well, try mine.<br><br>Wow.<br><br>Okay, no nepotism.<br><br>Okay, being as impartial<br>as is humanly possible,<br><br>I gotta say both<br>take first place.<br><br>Oh, come on.<br><br>Oh, you're so competitive.<br><br>Hey, see for yourself.<br><br>All right.<br><br>It is not an easy decision.<br><br>Okay, you ready?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Cheers?<br><br>Cheers.<br><br>Mm.<br><br>That's amazing.<br><br>Really?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>It's really good, the meat,<br><br>it's a really good choice.<br><br>Oh, thank you.<br><br>And, well, this is delicious.<br><br>Oh, I'm glad you like it.<br><br>I do.<br><br>Okay, are y'all finished?<br><br>Mm-hmm.<br><br>That's coming back to Uncle D.<br><br>One of my favorite things<br>out here is the produce.<br><br>Yeah, when I first<br>came out, I stayed<br><br>at this little<br>bed and breakfast,<br><br>and I ordered lunch and I saw<br>the owner go out the back door<br><br>and around the side<br>of the house, and<br><br>she picked the most<br>incredible tomato<br><br>that I've ever seen.<br><br>Most incredible tomato, eh?<br><br>I'm not kidding, I mean,<br>she brought it back in,<br><br>sliced it up, and made<br>the best bruschetta.<br><br>It was right then<br>that I realized<br><br>I was at the right<br>place for cooking.<br><br>You notice people have<br>their own gardens here?<br><br>I mean, Davide made it<br>sound like picking food<br><br>fresh off the vine was<br>a regular daily thing.<br><br>Well, yeah, yeah,<br>I mean, why not?<br><br>The growing conditions<br>here are just amazing.<br><br>You know, when I think of Italy,<br><br>this is exactly what I imagine.<br><br>So do you have a green thumb?<br><br>No, not really, never<br>really focused on it.<br><br>Well, when did you move here?<br><br>To Italy?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>A couple of years ago.<br><br>From where?<br><br>New York, same as you.<br><br>What?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Why didn't you say anything?<br><br>Oh, well, I couldn't,<br>I was being Roberto.<br><br>Well, why Italy?<br><br>Oh, man, well, the short answer,<br><br>same as you, to<br>better my cooking.<br><br>And the long answer?<br><br>The long answer?<br><br>It took me a while to decide<br>what it was I wanted to do.<br><br>I kind of wandered around a lot,<br><br>bounced around from different<br>careers for a few years.<br><br>My parents weren't<br>too happy about that.<br><br>But nothing really<br>clicked, you know?<br><br>Not until I discovered cooking.<br><br>Well, what made you decide to,<br><br>you know, pursue a<br>career as a chef?<br><br>All right, I know this<br>is gonna sound cliche.<br><br>My grandmother.<br><br>Really?<br><br>Yes, she was an amazing cook,<br><br>and we used to make stuff<br>in the kitchen all the time,<br><br>and yeah, I really enjoyed it.<br><br>And when I told my father<br><br>that's what I wanted<br>to do for a career,<br><br>he told me it was, well,<br>a waste of my potential.<br><br>Ouch.<br><br>Yeah, I mean, to be fair,<br><br>I wasted a lot of<br>opportunities back then,<br><br>so I can't really blame him.<br><br>So, uh, at the time, we got<br>in a big argument, and I left.<br><br>I told myself I'd never<br>come back until I made it.<br><br>I know it sounds childish,<br><br>but it's kind of a<br>matter of pride now.<br><br>No, I get it, so,<br><br>so you won't move back<br>until you get a job here?<br><br>Yeah, but not just any<br>job, a job as a chef.<br><br>Right, but you could<br>still move back to the US<br><br>and just not go home.<br><br>Yeah, I suppose, but for now,<br><br>I think I'd like to<br>just keep a distance.<br><br>Hmm.<br><br>More than you wanted to know?<br><br>No, I like learning about you.<br><br>You want to go pick some<br>ingredients for dinner?<br><br>Oh, yes.<br><br>A couple of incredible tomatoes<br><br>or something like that?<br><br>I think it's a great idea,<br>there's some right over here.<br><br>That was really good.<br><br>Why do you always<br>sound so surprised?<br><br>What I am surprised<br><br>about is how people<br>have been responding<br><br>to what we've been cooking<br>since I've been here.<br><br>You blowing up the internet?<br><br>No, just tiny ripples, maybe.<br><br>Wow, that's amazing.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Your publisher's<br>gotta be loving this.<br><br>Oh, I hope so, I mean,<br>I don't know if they care<br><br>about this as much as the<br>focus groups, but we'll see.<br><br>Hey, you two.<br><br>Hi.<br><br>Rob, good to see<br>you, guess what?<br><br>What?<br><br>I've got a property<br>investment company coming<br><br>to look at the house<br>again tomorrow.<br><br>Oh, that's great.<br><br>Yeah, yeah, these guys<br>have seen it before,<br><br>but I guess they're<br>serious about turning it<br><br>into a rental investment now.<br><br>So they're gonna come by<br>and then we're gonna go<br><br>to lunch and talk business.<br><br>Oh, well, if it's<br>about the house,<br><br>why don't you just<br>have lunch here?<br><br>Yeah, we could<br>whip something up.<br><br>Yeah, we could do that.<br><br>Oh, that'd be perfect.<br><br>All right, well, I guess<br>we'd better go shopping.<br><br>I don't know, do you<br>think fish is the way to go?<br><br>I don't know, I mean,<br>it's elegant, right?<br><br>Yeah, I guess it is.<br><br>Two of those one?<br><br>Unless, of course,<br>they don't like fish.<br><br>Oh, yeah, we should<br>definitely have a backup.<br><br>Like a chicken or goat?<br><br>Goat?<br><br>Those little cute ones<br>we saw at the farm?<br><br>Well, not those goats.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>So what are you thinking?<br><br>Um, I'll start on the<br>chicken, you start on the fish.<br><br>All right, you want to<br>just meet in the middle?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>All right.<br><br>And hey.<br><br>Yeah?<br><br>Thank you for doing this.<br><br>I'm happy to.<br><br>Oh, could you<br>bring me the arugula?<br><br>- Of course.<br>- Put it on top of this.<br><br>Here you go.<br><br>- Thank you.<br>- Looks very nice.<br><br>I know.<br><br>All right, you<br>ready for the tomatoes?<br><br>I am ready.<br><br>Excellent.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Hey, you want to try this?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>More salt.<br><br>Yeah?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Okay, that's my cue.<br><br>Good luck.<br><br>Hey, we should, uh, we<br>should get out of here.<br><br>All right, let's go.<br><br>Thank you so much<br>again for your help.<br><br>Oh, are you kidding<br>me, I was happy to.<br><br>You know how long<br>it's been since<br><br>I've had an actual<br>occasion to cook for?<br><br>And you were great<br>back there, by the way.<br><br>Yeah?<br><br>Yeah, like, no limitations,<br>just straight cooking.<br><br>Yeah, that was fun, wasn't it?<br><br>Yeah, I don't know why<br>you've been so unsure<br><br>about your cooking.<br><br>Well, I'm not unsure<br>about my cooking.<br><br>I'm just, well, I'm<br>unsure about this brand<br><br>that my publishers have<br>been trying to push on me,<br><br>and I understand why, it's just.<br><br>Yeah?<br><br>Yeah, I just, I didn't mean<br><br>to get stuck into<br>this diet category.<br><br>You know, it's like I<br>make one healthy thing<br><br>that's yummy and low calorie,<br><br>and then I have to<br>keep it up, even if...<br><br>If what?<br><br>It was a fluke.<br><br>Hmm, well, all right.<br><br>If you had a different niche<br>to cook for, what would it be?<br><br>No niche.<br><br>Just cooking, you know, whatever<br>I want, whenever I want.<br><br>You know, you can do<br>that, nobody's stopping you.<br><br>In theory, yes, but, I<br>mean, wouldn't it be crazy<br><br>to just give up on the<br>opportunity for a cookbook?<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>But I think you'll<br>figure it out.<br><br>Really?<br><br>I don't know about that.<br><br>So, um, I'll see you tomorrow?<br><br>Oh, definitely, yeah.<br><br>Thank you again for<br>your help, you know,<br><br>I know my uncle's<br>super grateful, too.<br><br>Oh, it's my pleasure.<br><br>Will you tell your uncle, uh,<br><br>good luck, and thanks?<br><br>Yeah, I will.<br><br>Good night.<br><br>Have a good night.<br><br>You too.<br><br>Hey, how was the meeting?<br><br>Oh, really good, yeah.<br><br>I think, uh, I think<br>they're gonna make an offer.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Of course, I've<br>said that before,<br><br>and nothing's come<br>of it, but boy,<br><br>having the meeting<br>here was a great idea,<br><br>and the food, fantastic.<br><br>Well, good.<br><br>In fact, I hope you don't mind<br><br>if we have the<br>leftovers for dinner?<br><br>No, not at all.<br><br>You know, I had this<br>friend back home.<br><br>We used to work at this<br>little cafe together,<br><br>and she refused<br>to eat leftovers.<br><br>She said it ruined the food.<br><br>Well, so what did she do<br><br>if she actually had<br>anything left over?<br><br>She just threw it away.<br><br>Well, well, I am not that picky.<br><br>Will you pass the fish?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>So your mom called today.<br><br>Oh, yeah, what did she want?<br><br>Oh, she was, uh,<br>checking up on you.<br><br>It's not what she actually<br>said, but I know my sister.<br><br>Well, what did you tell her?<br><br>I told her you're doing great.<br><br>You're working, exploring.<br><br>She said I should try to set<br>you up while you're out here.<br><br>Oh, great.<br><br>I'll admit, I don't<br>have a lot of people<br><br>in your age group.<br><br>Oh, no, please<br>don't worry about it.<br><br>Why, you got a lot<br>of guys back home?<br><br>No, no, nothing<br>like that, I just,<br><br>I've been super busy<br>with work lately,<br><br>so I just haven't the time.<br><br>No, I know how that goes, yeah.<br><br>Well, maybe while you're here,<br><br>it's all the more reason to<br>take a break now and then<br><br>and see what you<br>might be missing.<br><br>So, um, what's<br>with the shovel, hmm?<br><br>We are going on a hunt.<br><br>With shovels, it's a little<br>blunt, don't you think?<br><br>Well, not that kind of hunt.<br><br>Think of it more<br>like a treasure hunt.<br><br>You're not gonna tell me<br>any more than that, are you?<br><br>No, might as well<br>sit back and relax<br><br>'cause we've got a<br>little ways to go still.<br><br>All right.<br><br>All right, any ideas yet?<br><br>Hmm, since these<br>are pretty small,<br><br>I assume you're not planning<br>to bury me out here.<br><br>No.<br><br>Think of what's like<br>gold for a chef.<br><br>Is this about olive oil again?<br><br>No, not liquid gold.<br><br>Truffles.<br><br>We're looking for truffles.<br><br>My philosophy is, if<br>you don't want to buy them<br><br>because they're crazy<br>expensive, you find your own.<br><br>I love that, okay,<br>yeah, how do we do this?<br><br>Okay, it's hit or miss, really,<br><br>but you want to look for<br>typical mushroom conditions,<br><br>so it's like moist soil, usually<br>around the base of a tree.<br><br>Okay, are they visible<br>from the surface,<br><br>or do we have to dig?<br><br>We're gonna have to dig.<br><br>Treasure hunt, okay, I love it.<br><br>All right, let's try here.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>All right, you want to join?<br><br>Yeah, just anywhere?<br><br>Yeah, just try right in there.<br><br>All right, woo.<br><br>Oh, nice.<br><br>Here we go, let's try here.<br><br>Oh, why here?<br><br>Well, you see how the<br>dirt's kind of disturbed?<br><br>Oh, somebody already<br>found truffles here<br><br>and dug them up.<br><br>Yeah, or something,<br>like rodents or critters or something.<br><br>Oh, okay.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>You know, I never would<br>have done this at home.<br><br>You know, you can.<br><br>Yeah, I just, I never<br>would have thought about it.<br><br>Did you learn how<br>to do this here?<br><br>Mm-hmm, yeah.<br><br>Well, what else did you learn?<br><br>I learned how to make real<br>Italian pasta from scratch.<br><br>Really?<br><br>Yeah, the guy who taught<br>me was super patient.<br><br>It took me forever,<br>but I finally got it.<br><br>I love homemade pasta.<br><br>Oh, me too.<br><br>What else did you learn?<br><br>I saw a different way<br>for running a kitchen.<br><br>It's almost therapeutic here.<br><br>Really?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>I mean, usually kitchens are<br><br>such high stress<br>environments, that's weird.<br><br>Well, and they still can be.<br><br>You know Giovanna from the<br>bakery where I used to work?<br><br>She, our holidays used<br>to be so busy there.<br><br>She'd be barking orders at me,<br><br>""Roberto, get me<br>this, get me that.""<br><br>But she had this system.<br><br>Her movements were so<br>smooth and relaxed.<br><br>If you could step back<br>and watch, it's like a,<br><br>like a gentle symphony.<br><br>Hmm.<br><br>You know, you have that<br>way about you, too.<br><br>You think so?<br><br>Yeah, I mean,<br>watching you yesterday,<br><br>you just had so much<br>confidence and ease,<br><br>it was really nice.<br><br>Thanks, I think it<br>was fun, you know?<br><br>We make a good team.<br><br>Yeah, we do.<br><br>Wait, is this?<br><br>Oh, your first<br>truffle, congratulations.<br><br>I found one?<br><br>Oh my gosh.<br><br>Oh, I'm sorry.<br><br>Oh, no.<br><br>- It's so messy.<br>- It's okay.<br><br>Do you want to see<br>if there's more?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Hey, thank you again for today.<br><br>It was, it was really fun.<br><br>I honestly don't think<br><br>I ever would have<br>gone truffle hunting.<br><br>You're welcome.<br><br>So what have you got planned<br>for the rest of the day?<br><br>Oh, I don't know,<br>nothing really.<br><br>Well, uh, I was<br>wondering, would you-<br><br>- Oh.<br>- Oh.<br><br>What's going on?<br><br>No, no, it's okay,<br>I'll just, um,<br><br>I'll let you know if we can't<br>figure something else out.<br><br>No worries.<br><br>My uncle can't come get us.<br><br>He says he's hours away<br>at some work dinner thing.<br><br>Well, the mechanic can't<br>fix this today either.<br><br>He's gotta go back to the shop,<br><br>get some parts, and<br>he'll fix it tomorrow.<br><br>What, no tow truck?<br><br>Hmm, think of it more like a<br>doctor who makes house calls.<br><br>Yeah, your uncle's place<br>is pretty far from here,<br><br>but the mechanic says there's<br>an inn just down the road.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>No.<br><br>Sorry about that.<br><br>I'm sure we can find you a<br>ride if we just act for it.<br><br>No, no, I don't want<br>you to be stranded,<br><br>and like you said,<br>it's super far out.<br><br>We should just,<br><br>let's just try the inn?<br><br>All right.<br><br>He, uh, he wasn't kidding<br>when he said up the road.<br><br>No kidding, I'll just<br>try not to hyperventilate.<br><br>Hey, what did he say<br>back there, anyways?<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>Yeah, I mean, you<br>seemed a little upset.<br><br>Well, not upset.<br><br>Well, what did he say?<br><br>He offered us a place to stay.<br><br>Oh, that's nice.<br><br>Yeah, well, I was not<br>included in that invitation.<br><br>Oh, okay.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>I think he was quite<br>smitten with you.<br><br>I think the inn<br>is just up ahead.<br><br>Okay, great.<br><br>How can I help you?<br><br>Do you have any vacancies?<br><br>Oh, we have one room.<br><br>Just one?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Well, it's your call.<br><br>It's not like we<br>have any other options.<br><br>How many beds?<br><br>One, very comfortable.<br><br>Do you have any rollout beds?<br><br>No, no, just the baby crib.<br><br>All right, I<br>guess we'll take it.<br><br>The room, not the crib.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>All right, I'll take the<br>bed, you can have the floor.<br><br>I mean, sorry, that<br>came out wrong.<br><br>No, no, you should<br>absolutely have the bed.<br><br>I mean, you've been<br>driving all day,<br><br>so, you know, it's fine.<br><br>No, seriously, I sleep<br>great on the floor.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>You know, we don't<br>have to sleep now.<br><br>You know, just-<br><br>No, you want to<br>get something to eat?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Yeah, let's do it, yeah.<br><br>So what is this place, anyways?<br><br>It's great, right?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>It's this old<br>fort, and now it's-<br><br>This cute little village.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>To think we would<br>have just driven on by,<br><br>we would have missed it.<br><br>All right, it's not so bad<br>that we got stranded, then.<br><br>Not at all.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>- Grazie.<br>- Prego.<br><br>I'm starving.<br><br>Should have been<br>snacking on the truffles.<br><br>What, after all our hard work?<br><br>We could sell them<br>and use the money<br><br>to fund our little detour.<br><br>At least.<br><br>Hey, um,<br><br>you were gonna ask me<br>something earlier in the van.<br><br>What was it?<br><br>Oh, nothing, it's not important.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Actually, I was gonna ask you<br><br>if you wanted to<br>go out to dinner.<br><br>We are out to dinner.<br><br>I mean, like a proper<br><br>date.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Well, if you would<br>have asked that,<br><br>I could have said,<br>""I'd like that.""<br><br>Good.<br><br>So do you miss home?<br><br>Yeah, sometimes I do.<br><br>Think you'll ever<br>go back, you know,<br><br>even if you don't, um-<br><br>If I don't make it out here?<br><br>I don't know, I'd like to<br>think I wouldn't compromise,<br><br>but I know that sounds petty.<br><br>No, I get it.<br><br>Yeah, what about you?<br><br>Are your parents supportive<br><br>of what you do<br>with your cooking?<br><br>Yeah, they are,<br>actually, I mean,<br><br>my mom, she teaches me a lot.<br><br>She thinks I take things<br>too seriously.<br><br>Well, do you?<br><br>Yeah, I guess, but only<br>when it really matters,<br><br>you know, it's not like I<br>stress out all the time.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Yeah, you know,<br>that's the thing.<br><br>I'm always worried<br>about the stress.<br><br>They say it's the stress<br><br>that makes chefs burn<br>out so quickly, right?<br><br>I always wonder if<br>I'm gonna, you know,<br><br>I worked so hard to get there,<br>and then I just hate it.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Well, if that did happen<br><br>and you did end up<br>hating it, would you,<br><br>would you want to<br>take it all back?<br><br>No.<br><br>No, I'd still want to get there,<br><br>get the whole experience of it.<br><br>Yeah, and learn from it.<br><br>Yeah, what about you?<br><br>With your whole brownie<br>recipe sensation,<br><br>would you take that<br>back, if you could?<br><br>I mean, on the one<br>hand, maybe I would.<br><br>You know, I wouldn't be so boxed<br><br>into this corner<br>that I'm in, and<br><br>'cause on the other hand, I<br>wouldn't have all this attention<br><br>and interest from publishers,<br>so I, I don't know.<br><br>You might not have<br>come out here, either.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>That would have been terrible.<br><br>Yeah, it would have been.<br><br>We should, um-<br><br>Uh, yeah-<br><br>Go.<br><br>To-<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>It's getting late.<br><br>Uh, do you mind<br>if I take a shower?<br><br>Oh, yeah, no,<br>go, go right ahead.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Oh my gosh, ugh.<br><br>Yeah?<br><br>No, it's, like, 2:00 am here.<br><br>Yeah, I'm still in Italy.<br><br>Okay, hey, you know what?<br><br>If this isn't an emergency,<br>can we do this another time?<br><br>Yeah, now's not good.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>Is everything all right?<br><br>Yeah, sorry about that.<br><br>Well, what was it?<br><br>It's my dad.<br><br>He calls me to check in on me,<br><br>and remind me of all the things<br>I haven't accomplished yet.<br><br>He claims he still can't<br>get the timezone right<br><br>between New York and here.<br><br>Oh, I'm sorry.<br><br>What about your mom, does she,<br><br>she call you often?<br><br>Yeah, we talk a<br>couple times a month.<br><br>But she wants to come out here,<br><br>and I know if she does, he's<br>gonna come with her, so.<br><br>Must be hard for<br>her to have you so far away.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>It's okay.<br><br>And, you know, my daddy,<br><br>sometimes he just calls me<br>for the strangest things.<br><br>Like what?<br><br>Well, like a stupid<br>movie that he watched,<br><br>wants to tell me about,<br><br>or what he ate for breakfast.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Little things<br>like that, you know?<br><br>And then I realize that I<br>think he just was calling<br><br>'cause he wants<br>to hear my voice,<br><br>make sure I'm doing okay.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Well, I'm sorry I woke you up.<br><br>No, it's okay, good night.<br><br>Good night.<br><br>Well, the mechanic called,<br>said the van's ready.<br><br>Good.<br><br>Let's hope he doesn't<br>ask for your number.<br><br>It's your uncle?<br><br>No.<br><br>Wait, am I reading this right?<br><br>What?<br><br>It's a reply to one of my posts.<br><br>It's the restaurant<br>owner back home,<br><br>that they're opening up a<br>new high-end restaurant.<br><br>They are interested in<br>having me as the chef.<br><br>You're kidding.<br><br>No, look, they, there's even<br>a reply from my publisher.<br><br>""Just wait until her<br>cookbook comes out.""<br><br>Well, that's great.<br><br>Oh, I'm being super<br>insensitive, I'm sorry.<br><br>You just didn't get that<br>job, and I'm just... sorry.<br><br>No, it's fine, congratulations.<br><br>Hey.<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Well, you got the job offer<br><br>because of the posts, right?<br><br>Well, I mean, I think it's<br>like a interview at this point,<br><br>but I guess.<br><br>Okay, and the posts<br>were all about food.<br><br>What are you getting at?<br><br>You and I have been<br>cooking together.<br><br>It's not all you.<br><br>So what, you think my<br>posts are yours or something?<br><br>No, I'm not... I<br>mean, you know what?<br><br>Some of that stuff was,<br>and the rest were things<br><br>we made together,<br>and you know what?<br><br>This isn't coming out right.<br><br>No, no, no, no, so you think<br><br>because we cooked<br>together and you, what,<br><br>took me around to some tourist<br>foodie places that what?<br><br>I didn't say that, okay?<br><br>I mean, the posts are

later.<br><br>Hey.<br><br>Oh, hey, you're back.<br><br>Everything okay?<br><br>Yeah, the van got fixed, so.<br><br>Oh, good, good.<br><br>Well, you look content.<br><br>Oh, yeah, well, the<br>buyer made an offer<br><br>on the house, full price.<br><br>Really, that's great.<br><br>Yeah, and it's all<br>thanks to you and Rob.<br><br>Oh, I'm sure the house<br>had something to do with it.<br><br>Yeah, where is he,<br>did he stick around?<br><br>No.<br><br>Complicated.<br><br>Yeah, I know.<br><br>But, I mean,<br><br>they were my posts,<br>right, and it's not like<br><br>I asked him to take<br>me around everywhere.<br><br>Do you think he helped you?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>It's not like he did everything.<br><br>Does he think that?<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>I just...<br><br>I just

wrong, then?<br><br>Oh, no, I'm not the<br>one to judge that.<br><br>I mean, maybe you<br>don't want to admit it,<br><br>but from what I've seen,<br><br>there seems to be<br>something between you two.<br><br>So what do I do?<br><br>Well, if you care<br>for him at all,<br><br>then career, pride, mistakes,<br>they shouldn't get in the way.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Tom, don't miss out<br><br>on the Focaccia.<br><br>Oh, hey, there you are,<br>Rob was looking for you.<br><br>So I'll just be inside.<br><br>Hi.<br><br>Hey.<br><br>Look, I won't stay long.<br><br>I've been thinking, and<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>It was pretty arrogant of me<br><br>to want to take credit<br>for all your hard work.<br><br>No, I-<br><br>I was jealous,<br><br>and you were right about that.<br><br>You deserve this.<br><br>Rob, I don't know what to say.<br><br>You don't have to<br>say anything, but I am happy for you.<br><br>Rob.<br><br>I'll see you around.<br><br>""I've been overwhelmed<br>by the amazing response<br><br>to my experiences in Italy.<br><br>The wonderful food and recipes<br>aren't all my creations.""<br><br>I've failed<br>to give a lot of credit<br><br>where it's due, and that's<br>with the incredible Rob Cowley.<br><br>He has selflessly helped<br>me on this journey,<br><br>not just to discover<br>Italy, but myself.<br><br>I have been lucky<br>to get to know him<br><br>and see his culinary<br>passion firsthand.<br><br>He's an amazing<br>cook and deserves<br><br>to be a chef much<br>more than I do.<br><br>Any restaurant would<br>be lucky to have him.<br><br>All packed?<br><br>Yeah, just about.<br><br>I was thinking we<br>should go out for dinner,<br><br>since it's your last<br>night here, my treat.<br><br>Oh, you don't have to do that.<br><br>Well, it's not like<br>I get a lot of chances<br><br>to spoil my nieces and<br>nephews these days.<br><br>Well, it's not like I'm<br>seven years old anymore.<br><br>Exactly, so I can't cement<br>my role as favorite uncle<br><br>with a stuffed animal,<br>what do you think?<br><br>Sure, that sounds good.<br><br>So what are you gonna<br>do when you get home?<br><br>Probably return the advance<br>money to my publisher.<br><br>You're not doing it?<br><br>I wrote them an<br>email this morning,<br><br>telling them I don't think it<br>was gonna be finished in time.<br><br>I honestly don't think it's<br>ever gonna be finished,<br><br>you know, at least<br>not the way they<br><br>and I would both want, so.<br><br>Gosh, I'm sorry.<br><br>No, it's honestly not<br>what I wanted, anyways.<br><br>Yeah, what about the chef job?<br><br>I turned it down.<br><br>Rob?<br><br>I, um,<br><br>well, I hope he gets to<br>achieve all of his dreams.<br><br>You know, I really think<br>you're gonna miss all this.<br><br>Yeah, you know, I really am.<br><br>And I'm really gonna miss you.<br><br>Aw.<br><br>You know, about that,<br>I have been thinking,<br><br>Christmas is gonna be here<br>before we know it, and, um,<br><br>I kind of miss those snowy<br>Christmases back home, you know?<br><br>Oh, yeah, just the snow?<br><br>No, maybe a little<br>more than that.<br><br>It's past time<br>for me to move on,<br><br>just get back home,<br>get back to family.<br><br>We would love to have you home,<br><br>you know, not just<br>for the holidays.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Yeah, I'd like that, too.<br><br>Yeah?<br><br>I, um, I have a<br>confession to make.<br><br>I may have invited someone else.<br><br>You did?<br><br>Well, I was just thinking<br>it would be a shame<br><br>for you to leave Italy without<br>at least having said goodbye.<br><br>Hi.<br><br>Hi.<br><br>Um.<br><br>Uh, you know, that view<br>really is spectacular.<br><br>You probably ought<br>to go check it out.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>I'll take care of our order.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Sure.<br><br>Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt<br>your going away dinner.<br><br>I didn't think I'd<br>ever see you again.<br><br>Didn't think, or didn't want?<br><br>I'm really glad you're here.<br><br>I saw what you wrote.<br><br>You didn't have to say that.<br><br>Yeah, I guess I did, actually.<br><br>And you turned down the job?<br><br>Mm-hmm.<br><br>You shouldn't have done that.<br><br>No, it was the right decision.<br><br>I'm just, I'm so<br>sorry that I hurt you,<br><br>you know, after everything<br>that you've done for me,<br><br>and teaching me all the<br>things that you learned,<br><br>taking me around, I'm<br>just, I'm so sorry.<br><br>It's, it's okay.<br><br>I mean, I didn't<br>want the tour to end<br><br>because I was afraid that<br>I'd never see you again.<br><br>Really?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Me too, I mean,<br><br>you made me excited about<br>cooking again, you

fun.<br><br>Mm-hmm.<br><br>I just don't want to lose you.<br><br>Well, I mean, you don't have to.<br><br>I really hate to interrupt<br>this moment.<br><br>I don't suppose either<br>of you have

Yeah.<br><br>And this is all inspired<br>by the spring fair?<br><br>The color pallet was.<br><br>Ah, ok.<br><br>That's a step.<br><br>I just thought that we were<br>blending upscale and homey.<br><br>I did.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>I used white flour instead<br>of organic quinoa flour.<br><br>Ok.<br><br>It's good.<br><br>What?<br><br>You know what?<br><br>Let's just pause on the menu<br>for a beat<br><br>and get started on the design.<br><br>Come on!<br><br>You...<br><br>So, I've narrowed down<br>the colors for the accents.<br><br>You wanted neutrals, I wanted<br>something more rich.<br><br>So, I picked colors that were<br>solidly in the middle.<br><br>Mmmhmm.<br><br>And like we agreed,<br><br>all of the final decisions<br>are made together.<br><br>So, sand dune cladding<br>or walnut?<br><br>Sand dune.<br><br>Ok.

Yeah.<br><br>I kind of like a cherry<br>wood stain.<br><br>All right.<br><br>I think that's the winner.<br><br>Still understated, but it's...<br><br>- Still elegant.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>And it won't overshadow<br>that landscape.<br><br>Wow.<br><br>It's beautiful.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>I mean, this is the star<br>of the show.<br><br>No matter how good the food is<br>or how on point the decor.<br><br>People will always want to come<br>to this place for this.<br><br>Olivia: Yeah. Exactly.<br><br>Dax: Amazing.<br><br>What?<br><br>It's just funny.<br><br>What you notice when you<br>finally stop and slow down.<br><br>It's amazing.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Yeah, it really is.<br><br>Well, now we get to<br>speed up again.<br><br>No.<br><br>Let's get started.<br><br>Come on!<br><br>I am so happy my dad's<br>letting me do this.<br><br>Cheers to that.<br><br>And once we finish<br>the dining area<br><br>we can give our bar<br>a little makeover.<br><br>What?<br><br>What is this?<br><br>Oh, my gosh.<br>This was my mom's.<br><br>I wonder how it got here.<br><br>Oh!<br><br>Is that you?<br><br>Yeah, it is.<br><br>We were pretty adorable, huh?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>That's my mom.<br><br>Sandra.<br><br>Aw.<br><br>Oh, my gosh.<br><br>It's mom's take out menus.<br><br>She would get these<br>wherever she went<br><br>and she'd cross off<br>the menu item she tried.<br><br>And she had a rating system.<br><br>So, the heart meant<br>she loved it,<br><br>the star meant she thought<br>other people would like it,<br><br>and then the red X...<br><br>She didn't like it so much.<br><br>Exactly.<br><br>Oh, man. I loved<br>this place.<br><br>Their tochos were so good.<br><br>Did you just say ""tochos?""<br><br>Tater tot nachos.<br><br>They're amazing.<br><br>We don't have these in New York.<br><br>Oh, yeah.<br><br>This is the old diner<br>by the fish market.<br><br>They were so good until<br>they sold to a chain.<br><br>Oh, this one.<br><br>They had the best burgers<br>in town,<br><br>then they became a brunch spot.<br><br>Stuffed blue cheese<br>salmon burger<br><br>with grilled onions<br>and a fried pickle!<br><br>Mm-hm. That one was...<br><br>You know this is the most<br>comprehensive culinary history<br><br>of Crescent Lake you're probably<br>ever going to get.<br><br>Some of these are 20 years old. Amazing.<br><br>Do you mind if I hang onto these<br>for a little bit?<br><br>Yeah, sure.<br><br>I'll give them back, I promise,<br><br>I just, these are incredible.<br><br>Whatever you need, Mr. Chef.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Now, we paint.<br><br>So, when you said<br>""catch twist"" you meant...<br><br>Something unique to this place.<br><br>To my family, to you,<br><br>you know, something to really<br>make it ours.<br><br>Ok.<br><br>Oh you, you missed a spot.<br><br>I did not.<br><br>Oh, you did.<br><br>Where?<br><br>Right there.<br><br>Okay, well, you just pointed<br>to the whole thing, so.<br><br>Yeah, you're not a very<br>good stainer.<br><br>All right.

sounds like I need to be<br>using my fancy handwriting.<br><br>Yes, that's exactly<br>what we need.<br><br>Item tags no one can read.<br><br>Like a little...<br><br>Oh, sorry, it's my boss.<br><br>Jasmine, hi.<br><br>Olivia, darling,<br>sorry to call so late.<br><br>Are you sitting down?<br><br>No, why?<br><br>You might want to.<br><br>We landed the Skylyn!<br><br>Jasmine: I'll email over everything now.<br>They are ready to work.<br><br>Oh, I thought the start date<br>wasn't for three weeks?<br><br>It's all in the brief<br>I'm sending over.<br><br>Jasmine: You might have to cut<br>your trip short, a bit.<br><br>I can't cut my trip short, Jasmine.<br><br>It's part of being a partner<br><br>in the most sought-after design<br>firm in the country.<br><br>Jasmine: Oh, and we landed a<br>huge new designer, Kenzie Rob.<br><br>Have you heard of her?<br>She's perfect for the Skylyn.<br><br>Oh, I gotta go, see you Monday.<br><br>Oh...<br><br>What?<br><br>No, this design is all wrong.<br><br>Hey.<br><br>Hi.<br><br>Fabric for curtains,<br>which do you prefer?<br><br>I like the one on the left.<br><br>That was my choice as well.<br><br>Great minds think alike.<br><br>So, my designer, my chef,<br>what's on deck today?<br><br>Well, Dax is doing<br>the appetizers<br><br>for Abby's pottery fundraiser,<br><br>so I was thinking we could head<br>down to the studio,<br><br>get a feel for the space<br><br>and then maybe pick out<br>some pieces for Catch.<br><br>You're the boss.<br><br>All right.<br><br>- Later.<br>- Bye.<br><br>Do you travel a lot for work?<br><br>Yeah, well, I have, in the past.<br><br>I bet that's hard<br>on a relationship.<br><br>Well, I have one relationship<br>to maintain<br><br>and that's my restaurant.<br><br>Anything else has<br>to come second.<br><br>I totally get that.<br><br>Relationships just take up<br>so much time.<br><br>And energy.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Energy that ends up taking away<br>from work.<br><br>And it makes the work suffer.<br><br>Mm-hm.<br><br>Which is why I am taking<br>a dating break.<br><br>It's always good to do,<br>once in a while.<br><br>Get all that time<br>and energy back.<br><br>Exactly.<br><br>So, we're here for you<br>to see the space<br><br>and for us to pick out<br>some dish-ware.<br><br>Hey, guys.<br><br>I've got your stations<br>all set up.<br><br>Our what?<br><br>Come on!<br><br>Uh, Abs, are you sure we<br>couldn't just buy some pieces<br><br>you've already made?<br><br>You could, but this is more fun.<br><br>Ok.<br><br>So to start,<br><br>make sure both of your machines<br><br>are turned on<br>on the right-hand side.<br><br>And make sure both<br>of your hands are wet,<br><br>using your water bowl.<br><br>Start to pump the wheel quickly,<br><br>we're trying to loosen up<br>the clay.<br><br>And as you pump,<br>push the clay forward.<br><br>There you go, that looks great.<br><br>When the clay is loosened up,<br>we call it complies,<br><br>you can either continue<br>to raise it up<br><br>into something like a vase,<br><br>or push it down for a bowl<br>or a cup.<br><br>The trick is to keep<br>the clay moving<br><br>so it doesn't dry prematurely.<br><br>Got it?<br><br>- Got

The move up was<br>my idea. But...<br><br>And this new designer,<br>Kenzie Rob?<br><br>Was she Mrs. Codin's idea<br>or yours?<br><br>Kenzie Rob is a hot<br>up and comer.<br><br>Getting her on board is huge<br>for our company.<br><br>Even if she's not right<br>for the space.<br><br>I mean, her designs are nothing<br>like what Mrs. Codin wanted.<br><br>Thank you for the offer,<br><br>but... consider this<br>my official resignation.<br><br>I quit.<br><br>What? Why?<br><br>Because I can't work<br>for a company<br><br>that goes behind my back.<br><br>That doesn't value or trust<br>my instincts.<br><br>Please give my regards<br>to Mrs. Codin.<br><br>Abby, hi.<br><br>Hey.<br><br>I'm sorry for leaving<br>so quickly.<br><br>I just, well, Dax is planning<br>on leaving.<br><br>I guess he got an offer<br>at another restaurant.<br><br>And I was hoping that he would<br>tell you guys, but...<br><br>Are you sure about that?<br><br>Pretty sure.

Of course<br>you're invited.<br><br>Yeah?<br><br>Actually, you're<br>more than invited.<br><br>More?<br><br>More.<br><br>What my fiancé is trying to say<br><br>is that we're going to need<br>some help planning this wedding<br><br>if we're going to<br>pull it off on time.<br><br>And you are the most organized<br>person I've ever worked with.<br><br>So...<br><br>we were hoping that you<br>would be... our wedding planner.<br><br>Oh!<br><br>Listen, Kimmy tells me you're<br>not the biggest fan of romance.<br><br>Everybody keeps saying that!<br><br>But I like romance. I do.<br><br>Romance just doesn't seem to<br>like me very much.<br><br>Well, that's why I've<br>asked my nephew to help out.<br><br>I work better alone.<br><br>Think of him as your assistant?<br><br>Mm. I still<br>work better alone.<br><br>Oh, but I've met Bradley's<br>nephew several times.<br><br>Really sweet kid.<br><br>Hopeless romantic.<br><br>Everybody in the family<br>calls him Mr. Romance.<br><br>Okay...<br><br>I shouldn't be<br>saying this, but, uh,<br><br>he's my favourite nephew.<br><br>Ah! Ooh!<br><br>He's a bit of a black<br>sheep in a family, uh,<br><br>full of type-A businesspeople.<br>But he's super sweet.<br><br>And easy on the eyes,<br>if you know what I mean.<br><br>- Runs in the family.<br>- Oh!<br><br>Ohhh.<br><br>Oh!<br><br>I have so much work to do,<br><br>maybe...<br><br>your nephew could<br>handle this on his own?<br><br>Michael? Sweet kid,<br><br>just not the most reliable,<br>if you know what I mean?<br><br>Oh.<br><br>We were thinking that the two<br>of you would make a great team.<br><br>Yup, he'll bring the romance<br>and you can bring<br><br>the focus<br><br>and organization.<br><br>Mm.<br><br>Kind of give this wedding<br>planning the old one-two punch.<br><br>Uh!<br><br>I think this is a horrible idea.<br><br>What?<br><br>Nicole! I mean, you know<br>I love your unbridled honesty,<br><br>but I was hoping that you'd<br>be a little bit more...<br><br>I'm kidding!<br><br>- Gahhhh!<br>- Oh!<br><br>I would love to plan<br>your wedding!<br><br>See? I told you she'd say yes.<br><br>Ah, perfect!<br><br>Bradley has organized for<br>you two to meet this morning.<br><br>- Should be here any minute.<br>- This morning?<br><br>Nicole, you have to plan<br>a wedding in two weeks.<br><br>You have no time to waste.<br><br>Of course.<br><br>What in the world?<br><br>There he is now.<br><br>- That's your nephew?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Didn't I tell you<br>he's easy on the eyes.<br><br>Michael! Come on over here.<br>Hey! You brought dogs!<br><br>Hey, Uncle Brad!<br><br>Hi!<br><br>Kim.<br><br>Michael,<br><br>this is Nicole.<br><br>The woman I was<br>telling you about.<br><br>You're the woman from the park.<br><br>And you have dogs.<br><br>Lots of dogs.<br><br>I have a dog-walking business.<br><br>Oh!<br><br>Wait, you're not<br>allergic, are you?<br><br>No. No, no.<br><br>I'm just not the<br>biggest fan of dogs.<br><br>Ooh.<br><br>Do you two know each other?<br><br>- No.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>We met in the park yesterday.<br><br>He was playing the guitar and...<br><br>- Hm.<br>- Huh.<br><br>This is going to be<br>a lot of fun.<br><br>Why don't we<br>take 'em for a walk?<br><br>It'll distract 'em.<br>Come on, guys.<br><br>Now? I...<br><br>I have a lot of work to do.<br><br>Oh! Go for a walk.<br><br>It'll give you guys a chance<br>to get to know each other.<br><br>And, Nicole,<br><br>Bradley and I want<br>this wedding to be...<br><br>Fabulous!<br><br>I'll get right<br>on that, Ms. Price.<br><br>Please...<br><br>Call me Kim.<br><br>Okay...<br><br>Kim.<br><br>Thanks, Nicole.<br><br>Oh!<br><br>What?<br><br>Going to get a<br>sign for that.

She's good.<br><br>So you don't like dogs?<br><br>Uh, it's kind of a long story<br>and we have a ton of work to do.<br><br>Yeah, we're planning a wedding.<br><br>Yes, it's all very exciting.<br><br>I know, right?<br><br>I was being sarcastic.<br><br>You know, Kim and Bradley<br>warned me about you.<br><br>Warned you?<br><br>What did they say?<br><br>I'd rather not say.<br><br>Well, I'd rather not be<br>walking half a dozen dogs<br><br>and planning<br>my boss's wedding, so...<br><br>They said you might be<br>a little apprehensive.<br><br>Oh!<br><br>Well, that's true.<br><br>All right,<br>what have you got here?<br><br>Hey!<br><br>How to plan a wedding<br>in ten easy steps.<br><br>Step one, schedule,<br>schedule, schedule.<br><br>See? Now that is<br>really great advice.<br><br>I bet you think so!<br>Kim and Bradley told me<br><br>about you and your schedules.<br><br>Well, that's why they asked me<br>to help organize their wedding.<br><br>And the fact that you're<br>reading articles like this<br><br>is why they asked me to help.<br><br>We're going to make<br>an amazing team.<br><br>Amazing. Yeah...<br><br>That's the first word<br>that popped into my head.<br><br>So, sarcasm is your default?<br><br>Sorry. It's just...<br><br>I have so much work to do and<br><br>there's this promotion coming up<br><br>that I really, really,<br>really want.<br><br>A-ha! There it is.<br><br>What?<br><br>Kim is your boss, so if you<br>do a great job at her wedding,<br><br>it'll go a long way in having<br>her in your corner<br><br>come promotion time.<br>Am I right?<br><br>Thought so.<br><br>Okay, so you handle<br>the scheduling and planning.<br><br>I'll take care<br>of the romance, okay?<br><br>You know, that's what<br>Kim and Bradley said.<br><br>They called it...<br><br>""the old one-two punch.""<br><br>What was all of that?<br><br>- Uh, punches.<br>- Uh-huh.<br><br>You know, the old one-two punch.<br><br>You've never thrown a<br>punch before, have you?<br><br>I've never had to.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Well, uh, leave the romance...<br><br>And the punching to me.<br><br>Teamwork.<br><br>Come on. Come on, Lona.<br>Come on, Lona.<br><br>Come on. Come on, guys.<br><br>Teamwork.<br><br>So, we're walking these dogs<br>and then he's all, like,<br><br>""So I guess sarcasm<br>is your baseline""?<br><br>So, he's a fast judge of<br>character is what you're saying.<br><br>Ha-ha-ha.<br><br>But don't you think<br>you should know someone better<br><br>before you say<br>something like that?<br><br>Once he gets to know you,<br>he'll love you,<br><br>just like we all do.<br><br>Great.<br><br>O-M-G! Look at this dress.<br><br>Uh... it's a<br>beautiful dress.<br><br>I love wedding magazines.<br><br>So, what's the next steps?<br><br>Um, we're going to go check<br>some wedding venues tomorrow.<br><br>You're so lucky.<br><br>Back from the walk so soon?<br><br>Yeah. Uh, Michael<br>had to get the dogs back.<br><br>Isn't he great?<br><br>Sure is!<br><br>That's what Nicole was saying.<br><br>Really?<br><br>'Cause usually when Nicole<br>says something nice about a guy,<br><br>she's being sarcastic.<br><br>Ha!<br><br>What's wrong with my<br>soon-to-be nephew?<br><br>Does he prefer Google Docs<br>over Excel?<br><br>Um, no. We're just<br><br>two very different people,<br><br>but I think<br>we'll make a good team.<br><br>I'm sure you will.<br><br>And didn't I tell you?<br>He's easy on the eyes.<br><br>Oh. Those flowers? Hideous.<br><br>Burn it.<br><br>Hey.<br><br>Hey. Good morning.<br><br>These dresses are gorgeous!<br>You're so lucky.<br><br>That's what people<br>keep telling me.<br><br>Oh, come on. Even you<br>can't find a way to hate this.<br><br>And, yet, I have<br>found so many ways.<br><br>You should see this guy,<br>Michael. He's...<br><br>playing guitar one day<br>and walking dogs the next.<br><br>I mean, who lives like that?<br><br>So why did you say yes?<br><br>Because I had no choice.<br><br>Rule number one...<br>You never say no to your boss.<br><br>Especially when you<br>want a promotion.<br><br>Well, it's better than<br>sitting in an office all day.<br><br>What? Checking out wedding<br>venues with some cute guy.<br><br>Wait, this Michael guy is cute?<br><br>You never mentioned that before.<br><br>Hm. I see what's going on here.<br><br>What?<br><br>Maybe you like him?<br><br>Like him? I barely know him<br><br>and what I do know is more<br>annoying than anything else.<br><br>Okay. You go hang out<br>with the cute boy all day<br><br>and act annoyed by it.<br><br>Trust me!<br><br>I would take my schedules<br>and my spreadsheets any day.<br><br>Look at this photo!<br>These two are so in love.<br><br>Those are two models<br>who are paid to look that way.<br><br>Well, these two<br>are definitely in love.<br><br>Michael! You are so funny!<br><br>Are you a comedian?<br><br>Uh, no. Um...<br>I'm a musician.<br><br>Oh, that's pretty good, too.<br><br>Some of my music is<br>funny. Unintentionally.<br><br>Oh! Funny guy.<br><br>Hey!<br><br>Hey! Uh, Janette,<br>this is Nicole,<br><br>the woman I told you about.<br><br>I'm Janette, the<br>assistant wedding coordinator.<br><br>Nice to meet you.<br><br>Mm-hm. Let's get started,<br>shall we?<br><br>Follow me.<br><br>She seems, uh...<br><br>friendly.<br><br>She was super nice<br>until you got here.<br><br>I noticed that.<br><br>Did you say something<br>about me to her?<br><br>Nothing bad.<br><br>What did you tell her.<br><br>That you were a smart,<br>funny executive<br><br>with a bright future<br>ahead of you.<br><br>Huh. What did<br>you really tell her?<br><br>Pachelbel's CanonThat you're an<br>over-organized, anti-romance<br><br>wedding hater.<br><br>Oh!<br><br>I am not an over-organized,<br><br>anti-romance...<br><br>Wedding hater.<br><br>Well, over-organized, okay.<br>But I take that as a compliment.<br><br>I most certainly am<br>not anti-romance,<br><br>nor do I hate weddings.<br><br>Sorry about that.<br><br>The Davidsons? They are getting<br>married here in a few weeks.<br><br>Such a cute couple.<br><br>- So cute.<br>- Ah.<br><br>Blah.<br><br>Pardon?<br><br>I said, ""Yeah.<br><br>Super cute!""<br><br>Moving along.<br><br>Hey, I'm trying to get Janette<br>on our side.<br><br>Getting a venue like this<br>on such short notice<br><br>is a big ask.<br><br>I know. I'm sorry!<br>I just...<br><br>Just do your thing.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Oh, Janette! Um,<br><br>this place looks very familiar.<br><br>Was it featured in<br>Wedding Quarterly's<br><br>Top Ten Venues List?<br><br>Yes! Oh my gosh.<br><br>I am so impressed<br>that you noticed.<br><br>Isn't he amazing?<br><br>Very amazing.<br><br>You are a very lucky girl.<br><br>No, we're not...<br><br>Oh, you... No,<br>we're not together.<br><br>Sorry, I just assumed<br>she was your girlfriend.<br><br>Nope. No girlfriend.<br><br>Single?<br><br>Interesting.<br><br>Hm. Me too.<br><br>Huh.<br><br>Ah, um, Janette<br><br>would you mind showing us<br>where we'll be having<br><br>the reception?<br><br>Sure.<br><br>Follow me.<br><br>Ah...<br><br>And the D-J booth<br>usually goes up right there,<br><br>leaving seating<br>for up to 100 people.<br><br>Hm.<br><br>This is stunning, Janette.<br><br>Oh, yes. It's very...<br><br>romantic, Janette.<br><br>I actually have another showing<br><br>but I will leave you<br>guys some information.<br><br>It has the pricing and<br>everything else you could need.<br><br>Great. Thank you.<br><br>- And Michael?<br>- Yes?<br><br>This is my cell number...<br><br>Just in case.<br><br>Just in case... what?<br><br>I don't know. Ah, pretty girls just<br><br>give me their numbers sometimes.<br>I have no idea why.<br><br>Maybe I should hang on to it,<br>you know?<br><br>If anybody's going to call<br>with questions,<br><br>it'll probably be me.<br><br>I have a surprise for you.<br><br>Ooh! I guess<br>nobody told you?<br><br>Told me what?<br><br>I hate surprises.<br><br>I have a theory that people<br>who say they hate surprises<br><br>actually really love them.<br><br>Nope. I hate surprises.<br><br>It's on my list, along with,<br>""going with the flow"",<br><br>""trusting in the universe"" and<br>overall general spontaneity.<br><br>Okay. Do you, at least,<br>like sandwiches?<br><br>- Huh?<br>- All right. Don't hate me.<br><br>Oh, I don't like<br>the sound of this.<br><br>I may have just switched your<br>schedule around a little bit.<br><br>You did what?<br><br>There is this, ah, place<br>around the corner that makes<br><br>the most amazing sandwiches.<br><br>And?<br><br>And I called the other venues<br>that we're going to see today,<br><br>and I just moved things around a<br>little bit so that we would<br><br>have time to grab some lunch.<br><br>""You""<br><br>changed ""my"" schedule?<br><br>It's going to be worth it.<br><br>Trust me.<br><br>Mm-mm.<br><br>This is a really good sandwich.<br><br>My dad always said<br>the way to a woman's heart<br><br>was through her stomach.<br><br>You could take Janette<br>here on your first date.<br><br>Yeah. I don't think<br>that's going to happen.<br><br>She not your type?<br><br>This might sound cliché,<br><br>but I may be getting back<br>together with my ex, Julie.<br><br>Why?<br><br>She reached out.<br>We started talking.<br><br>Obviously, there were problems<br>with the relationship,<br><br>but it was also really amazing<br>sometimes, too.<br><br>And love is always worth<br>fighting for.<br><br>Also something my dad taught me.<br><br>Sounds like you're<br>pretty close to your family.<br><br>So, the other day, when we met,<br><br>and I was playing that song...<br><br>Did I overreact?<br><br>No, no. I-I get it.<br><br>That song reminded you<br>of a bad break-up.<br><br>I should've just<br>put in my headphones.<br><br>If you had requested something,<br><br>what would it have been?<br><br>I'm curious. Like, what<br>kind of music do you listen to?<br><br>Really obscure stuff. Honestly.<br><br>Like?<br><br>Well, a few years ago,<br><br>I got really into this band<br>out of Portland<br><br>called Roadside Rescue.<br><br>Hm.<br><br>I haven't listened to them,<br>you know, in a few years.<br><br>So, how do you get roped into<br>planning your uncle's wedding?<br><br>Why are you changing<br>the subject?<br><br>You don't want people to know<br>too much about Nicole Waters?<br><br>Seriously, you must have<br>other things to do? Work?<br><br>I am taking a little<br>break from work right now.<br><br>I'm just playing the odd gig,<br>walking dogs here and there.<br><br>And?<br><br>And Bradley is the only uncle<br>that I really like.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>He said you were a bit<br>of a black sheep in the family?<br><br>Bradley's always been<br>there for me.<br><br>So, I want to make sure<br>that this is really special<br><br>for him and Kim.<br><br>Hm.<br><br>Plus, I want to make a good<br>impression on Kim.<br><br>I mean, she's going<br>to be family now.<br><br>And I thought this<br>would be really fun.<br><br>Fun?<br><br>Planning a wedding is never fun.<br><br>No, planning your own wedding<br>is never fun.<br><br>Why do you know so much<br>about wedding planning?<br><br>Four sisters,<br>no brothers, all married.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Um... Please.<br><br>There's lots.<br><br>We could... Here.<br>I'll take this one.<br><br>Uh, so how did you get<br>roped into planning a wedding?<br><br>For your boss?<br><br>Your soon-to-be aunt<br>is great. Honestly.<br><br>But I've been working<br>for her for a while now<br><br>and we just haven't<br>found a way to...<br><br>Gel?<br><br>Yes! Gel. Exactly.<br><br>So you think planning<br>her wedding might help?<br><br>Well, for the first time ever<br><br>she insisted I call her Kim.<br><br>So, I guess that's a start?<br><br>I've only known you<br>a small amount of time, but...<br><br>it's pretty obvious<br>that you're a smart,<br><br>focused woman who<br>probably has good ideas.<br><br>So, you'll be fine.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>You just need to learn how to<br>go with the flow.<br><br>You know?<br>Trust the universe.<br><br>Ha, ha, ha.<br><br>We should probably get going.<br><br>Ah, there might be traffic and I<br>would hate for us to be late.<br><br>Look at you!<br><br>Making time for traffic,<br>planning out schedules.<br><br>Maybe I'm rubbing off on you.<br><br>Oh!<br><br>Why don't you grab that and<br>I will go take care of the bill.<br><br>Hello?<br><br>I am just calling to see<br>how you and Michael are doing.<br><br>Things are going well.<br><br>Um, we're on our way<br>to Crystal Banquet Hall.<br><br>Oh, that's my favourite venue.<br><br>Thank you so much, Nicole.<br>This means a lot to me.<br><br>Of course, Ms. Price.<br><br>I told you. It's Kim.<br><br>It's my pleasure, Kim.<br><br>Oh! Ah, hold on. I am just<br>getting a text message<br><br>from my contact over at<br>Crystal Banquet Hall.<br><br>Oh, what are they saying?<br><br>No, no, no, no, no, no.<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Oh, Kim. I'm sorry<br><br>but they just gave their<br>last slot to someone else.<br><br>What happened?<br><br>I am sorry.<br><br>I promise we will find you<br>something that is just as good!<br><br>We'll talk about it<br>in the morning.<br><br>So, ready to check<br>out venue number two?<br><br>Um...<br><br>Who did you talk to over at<br>Crystal Banquet Hall?<br><br>Who did I talk to?<br><br>Yeah. When you changed<br>the time of our meeting,<br><br>who did you confirm it with?<br><br>Oh, no one. When I called<br>it went to voice mail,<br><br>so I just left a message.<br><br>- Oh.<br>- What. What's wrong?<br><br>Well, Michael, there was<br>a very slim chance<br><br>that they were going<br>to be able to slip us in<br><br>and someone else has<br>just booked our date.<br><br>Sorry, I thought...<br><br>Knew we should've<br>stuck to my schedule!<br><br>Well, look, there's a bunch of<br>other places<br><br>that we're supposed to look at.<br>Why don't we...<br><br>This was Kim's<br>number one choice.<br><br>Wh-what are you doing?<br><br>None of these other places<br>will do. So...<br><br>I'm going to make a new list.<br><br>I'm going to find us<br>something even better.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>But you can still go do the<br>rest of the tours. Maybe, um,<br><br>find us a back-up.<br><br>I'm going to find a way<br>to fix this.<br><br>I was really just trying<br>to help. I didn't...<br><br>Ah, I told them<br>I work better on my own.<br><br>Wow. Okay.<br><br>Hi. Is this Summer Ranch<br>and Events?<br><br>I, uh, could I please<br>check your schedule?<br><br>Yes, I'll hold.<br><br>- Hey!<br>- Hey.<br><br>So, how did it go?<br><br>I never want to see<br>another banquet hall<br><br>or photo garden again.<br><br>Oof.<br><br>Wow! These are beautiful.<br><br>Yeah. The venues<br>were beautiful.<br><br>Quick sidenote...<br>Expensive as heck.<br><br>I can imagine.<br><br>Oh, you don't have to imagine.<br>The prices are right there<br><br>on the back pages.<br><br>Yikes.<br><br>Well, at least you had<br>the nephew to help you out.<br><br>Yeah...<br><br>That didn't exactly work out.<br><br>He changed my schedule<br><br>and we lost<br>Kim's favourite venue.<br><br>Why did he change your schedule?<br><br>Had you made a mistake?<br><br>Seriously? Me?<br><br>Mistake?<br><br>Right.<br><br>He wanted to go<br>to a sandwich shop!<br><br>A sandwich shop?<br><br>In all fairness to him,<br><br>it was an awesome sandwich and...<br><br>it was kind of nice<br>getting to know him.<br><br>He actually seems<br>like a good guy.<br><br>That sounds promising.<br><br>Nope. Not promising.<br><br>What did you do?<br><br>What I always do.<br><br>You pushed him away and told<br>him you work better on your own?<br><br>- Bingo!<br>- Nicole!<br><br>What?<br><br>I do work better on my own.<br><br>But, ugh...<br><br>I feel kind of bad<br>about how I treated Michael.<br><br>Well, can you fix it?<br><br>The Michael situation<br>or the Kim situation?<br><br>Both?<br><br>I'd better.<br><br>There is a lot riding on this.<br><br>I can't let Kim down and I don't<br>want to mess up this wedding.<br><br>Uh! And now I have to go into<br>work tomorrow and tell Kim<br><br>why she can't have her<br>favourite wedding venue.<br><br>I'm sure she'll understand.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Kim will understand.<br><br>I don't understand.<br><br>There was a mix-up<br>with one of my schedules.<br><br>A mix-up? With one of your<br>schedules? I don't believe it.<br><br>Unfortunately, it's true.<br><br>Oh, we loved that place.<br><br>So did Michael and I.<br><br>Wait...<br><br>Did Michael mess things up?<br><br>Michael?<br><br>Yeah. I mean, the Nicole<br>I know doesn't make mistakes<br><br>but Michael, on the other hand,<br><br>well...<br><br>Um...<br><br>Actually...<br><br>No. It wasn't Michael.<br><br>It was me.<br><br>I made<br><br>a<br><br>Mistake.<br><br>Sure.<br><br>Okay, well, no more mistakes.<br><br>I need you two to go pull a few<br>wedding dress options for me.<br><br>Wedding dress options?<br><br>Yeah. I mean, if I go myself,<br>I will be there for days.<br><br>So I just need you<br>to weed out the ugly ones.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>I'm thinking...<br><br>trumpet fit and flare.<br>What do you think?<br><br>Uhhhh... Trumpet fitted<br><br>and...?<br><br>Trumpet fit and flare.<br><br>Michael will know<br>what I'm talking about.<br><br>Trumpet fit and flare.<br><br>Peter! It is so nice<br>to see you.<br><br>Nicole, you know<br>our CEO, Mr. Banks.<br><br>Oh! Uh, only by name, sir,<br>but it's very nice to meet you.<br><br>Ah, yes.

Kay.<br><br>You know so much more<br>about this stuff than I do.<br><br>I mean, heck!<br><br>I think you know more about<br>this stuff than most people.<br><br>Guilty.<br><br>I mean, there's the-the<br>wedding venue, the wedding cake,<br><br>caterers, music, flowers!<br><br>Reception, first dance,<br>menu, invitations,<br><br>- photographer, videographer...<br>- Okay, I get it.<br><br>There is a boatload of stuff<br>that we have to do.<br><br>Wait... we?<br><br>Look, I can organize the heck<br>out of anything.<br><br>But...<br><br>I really need this wedding<br>to be something special.<br><br>And that's where I come in.<br>You see, I bring the magic.<br><br>Well, I said special<br><br>but if you need to<br>use the term magic,<br><br>then knock yourself out.<br><br>Honestly, we're going to need<br>a little bit more<br><br>than just magic<br>to pull this off.<br><br>We're going to need a miracle.<br><br>We?<br><br>Okay, yes. I will<br>help you plan this wedding.<br><br>Great!<br><br>Okay, here's what I have<br>for a plan of attack.<br><br>Ahhh. You made...<br>You made charts? Graphs?<br><br>Yeah, I made charts<br>and graphs and schedules!<br><br>Doesn't everybody?<br><br>No. Hey!<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>On the house.<br><br>- Oooh.<br>- It's your lucky day.<br><br>We are going to need it.<br><br>Yes, we are.<br><br>Here's to a wedding miracle.<br><br>To a miracle wedding.<br><br>That's hot.<br><br>So, decided to start<br>with something easy, huh?<br><br>Kim just wanted us<br>to pull a few dresses for her.<br><br>Hello. I'm Vicky.<br><br>Hi. I'm Nicole.<br>We spoke on the phone earlier.<br><br>Yes! Pulling a few<br>designs for your boss.<br><br>Yeah. And this is Michael.<br><br>- Hi.<br>- He's here to help.<br><br>Excellent. Well, uh,<br>before we get started,<br><br>do you have any idea of what<br>your boss is looking for?<br><br>Something pretty.<br><br>Something pretty?<br><br>Yeah. With one of those long<br>things at the back, you know?<br><br>- A train?<br>- Yes, that's it. A train.<br><br>The bride wants a train.<br><br>Yeah. Maybe. A really,<br>really long one.<br><br>Oh, and can you do pockets?<br><br>So, your boss wants something<br>pretty with a long train<br><br>and pockets?<br><br>Yeah. I mean, that sounds like<br>a pretty good place to start.<br><br>And for the silhouette?<br><br>- The silhouette?<br>- Well, what's her body type.<br><br>Kim's body type...<br><br>Voluptuous?<br><br>Voluptuous. Yes!<br><br>That's the word.<br><br>So, no A-lines.<br>Perhaps an empire?<br><br>Uh-huh.<br><br>You're doing a great job,<br>but do you mind if I<br><br>take over from here?<br><br>Please.<br><br>Yes, the bride<br>is a bit voluptuous,<br><br>so an empire would be great.<br><br>Or maybe a<br>trumpet fit and flare.<br><br>Oh, yes! The trumpet thing!<br><br>She mentioned that.<br><br>Great. So, we'll start<br>with a trumpet fit and flare...<br><br>I'm thinking scoop neck, sleeveless?<br><br>Fabric?<br><br>Jersey.

Even you've got to be<br>excited about this!<br><br>Trust me, I couldn't be happier.<br><br>If I'd made one more mistake,<br>think Kim might have fired me.<br><br>You told Kim it was your<br>fault we lost the first venue?<br><br>- Yeah.<br>- Why? It was my mistake.<br><br>Look, she might be my boss,<br>but you're going to be family.<br><br>You don't want to start off<br>on the wrong foot, right?<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>I may not be the<br>""free spirit"" you are<br><br>but I can still be pretty cool.<br><br>So I'm starting to see.<br><br>So, why are you this...<br><br>""free spirit""?<br><br>Free spirit?<br><br>I was being polite.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Were your parents hippies?<br><br>- Ah!<br>- I knew it!<br><br>No, the opposite actually.<br>Corporate types.<br><br>My whole family is.<br><br>Like your Uncle Bradley? Hm.<br><br>So you were the black sheep<br>from birth?<br><br>No, I was a<br>suit-and-tie guy, too.<br><br>What happened?<br><br>Well, uh,<br><br>when I was in college<br>my dad got really sick...<br><br>Passed away.<br><br>Michael, I'm sorry. I didn't...<br><br>It's okay. It was<br>a long time ago.<br><br>But it made me realize that<br>life is short, you know?<br><br>Can turn on a dime.<br><br>It's true.<br><br>My entire family is CEO types,<br>big-shot lawyers.<br><br>Every time we have a<br>family vacation<br><br>it always turns into this<br>competition about<br><br>who's driving<br>the more expensive car<br><br>or who bought<br>a vacation house where.<br><br>I can see how that<br>would be annoying.<br><br>But, as a kid, that's all<br>I wanted. Suit, tie, briefcase.<br><br>And then your<br>father passes away.<br><br>And I realized that no matter<br>how much money you make or<br><br>however hard you work,<br>it can all end in a second.<br><br>So, why not have fun instead?<br><br>So, you started to look<br>at things a little differently.<br><br>Yeah. I picked up the guitar,<br>started singing in public.<br><br>Just doing all of the things<br>that I always wanted to do<br><br>but I was too scared to.<br><br>Well,<br><br>you, uh, got pretty good<br>at the singing part, too.<br><br>Well, thank you.<br><br>I want my life to be more<br>about experiences than money.<br><br>So, is this where the idea<br>of ""Mr. Romance"" came to be?<br><br>No, uh,<br><br>I've been a hopeless romantic<br>since junior high.<br><br>Ah.<br><br>You know, deep down,<br>I think everybody is a romantic.<br><br>Yeah, present company included.<br><br>Really?<br><br>Really.<br><br>Sometimes you just have to<br>dig a little deeper.<br><br>Oh!<br><br>Bradley!<br><br>Hi! Nicky. Hey, great job<br>on the wedding venue.<br><br>Kim and I love it.<br><br>Thanks. I'm happy to help.<br><br>Is she around?<br><br>- Uh...<br>- If by ""she"" you mean<br><br>your future wife,<br>then ""she"" is right here.<br><br>Pumpkin.<br><br>Sugar bear. Mwah.<br><br>Ah, Nicole,<br><br>you know that Bradley and I<br>have been so impressed<br><br>with everything you've<br>been able to accomplish.<br><br>Especially on such short notice.<br><br>I feel like<br>there's a ""but"" coming.<br><br>No, we're really happy<br>with everything so far.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>- But...<br>- Ah.<br><br>We would love to add<br>one thing to your plate.<br><br>Oh! Okay.<br><br>See, I told you she'd be fine.<br><br>Bradley and I would like<br>you and Michael to plan<br><br>a small little engagement party.<br><br>An engagement party?<br><br>- Yeah.<br>- Yeah. Nothing crazy,<br><br>just a few dozen family members.<br><br>Uh-huh.<br><br>Yeah, Bradley and I were<br>hoping to get away<br><br>without doing one,<br>but a lot of family<br><br>have been asking to meet<br>before the big day.<br><br>- Yeah.<br>- Again, nothing crazy.<br><br>Maybe a private room at a<br>really nice restaurant?<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Just close family<br><br>and maybe a few<br>executives from this firm?<br><br>Executives from this firm?<br><br>Obviously, you and Michael<br>would be invited, too,<br><br>and I think you two<br>should bring dates.<br><br>- Oh.<br>- Oh, Sugar Bear.<br><br>Nicole doesn't do<br>the dating scene.<br><br>- Hm.<br>- Neither does Michael.<br><br>- Really?<br>- But he's so cute!<br><br>Yeah, he's all about romance,<br>but when it comes down<br><br>to actually asking a woman out,<br>he's, uh...<br><br>No-such-luck.<br><br>- Huh.<br>- So, Nicole,<br><br>do you think that this is<br>something that you and Michael<br><br>can pull off?<br><br>Oh! An engagement party?<br>Ha-ha. That's no problem.<br><br>Great.<br><br>Bam.<br><br>Bam. Whoosh.<br><br>Bam?<br><br>An engagement party?<br>That's crazy.<br><br>I know, but they really want<br>it and I can't let Kim down.<br><br>I know a few restaurants<br>I can reach out to.<br><br>Leave it to me.<br><br>Great.<br><br>Michael, I would not be able to<br>pull this off without you. I...<br><br>I owe you one.<br><br>Well, actually,<br>I was about to give you a call.<br><br>Yeah. What's up?<br><br>I need a favour.<br><br>Oh. Sure.<br><br>Anything.<br><br>You're not going to like it.<br><br>Come on. Come on. Yes. Yes.<br><br>Come on. No! Don't eat that.<br>All right, let's go this way.<br><br>Come on.<br><br>Come on, Corgi.<br><br>Now, this is a sight to see.<br><br>I feel like I should<br>take a picture.<br><br>Don't you dare.<br><br>I thought you didn't like dogs?<br><br>I'm warming up to them.<br>I think, uh...<br><br>I think Thorgi likes me.<br><br>Thorgi is a good<br>judge of character.<br><br>I really appreciate this.<br>Thank you.<br><br>You owe me big time.<br><br>I just had a meeting<br>with a club owner.<br><br>They want to hire me to<br>play two nights a week.<br><br>Oh, my gosh! That's amazing!<br><br>- Congratulations.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>There's record executives<br>in there all the time.<br><br>Like, this could turn into<br>something really big for me.<br><br>I'm so happy for you!<br><br>Oh, we're doing that?<br><br>Okay, well, I couldn't<br>have done it without you.<br><br>Well, I wouldn't be<br>pulling off this wedding stuff<br><br>if it wasn't for you,<br>so we're even.<br><br>Still, I know you don't love<br>dogs, so I feel like, maybe,<br><br>I owe you dinner or something?<br><br>Dinner like a...<br><br>Like a date? But I...<br><br>I thought you<br>and your ex were...?<br><br>We tried. It's<br>not going to happen.<br><br>How could it not work out?<br>You are such an amazing guy.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>But I could say<br>the same for you.<br><br>What do you mean?<br><br>Well, we've been working<br>together on this wedding<br><br>for a while now and,<br><br>I don't know, from my<br>perspective, you are...<br><br>you're smart, you're funny,<br>you're beautiful,<br><br>you're passionate<br>about your work.<br><br>Guilty as charged.<br><br>So...<br><br>What's the deal with<br>you not having a boyfriend?<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>I mean, other than you're<br>dislike of dogs,<br><br>I can't see<br>anything wrong with you.<br><br>I wasn't always<br>Miss Grumpy Pants about romance.<br><br>I just thought my last boyfriend<br>was ""the one"", you know?<br><br>I know the feeling, sure.<br><br>But when I'd ask him about our<br>future together, he'd...<br><br>always say he wasn't ready<br>to get married, and...<br><br>And?<br><br>Well, the break-up crushed me.<br><br>I'd always pictured us<br>getting married,<br><br>buying a house, having kids.<br>You know, the whole nine yards.<br><br>Okay, but, I mean,<br>everybody has bad break-ups.<br><br>It's no reason to<br>turn your back on love.<br><br>Well...<br><br>like a month after we broke up,<br><br>I saw that he was<br>engaged to his ex.<br><br>Ah.<br><br>So, it wasn't that he<br>didn't want to get married.<br><br>It's just that he didn't want<br>to get married to me.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>Wow. So, I guess planning<br>a wedding<br><br>wasn't exactly on the top<br>of your to-do list?<br><br>No, it wasn't.<br><br>There it is.<br><br>What?<br><br>Your laugh.<br><br>I love it when I make you laugh.<br><br>Um...<br><br>So, Kim and Bradley's<br>engagement party?<br><br>Yes, the engagement party.<br>Uh, so... come on, guys...<br><br>I called...<br><br>I called a couple of places.<br>What I found out is that<br><br>there are a million people<br>trying to get space right now,<br><br>but we have a good shot...<br><br>- Oh, yeah?<br>- 'Cause Kim has a lot of money.<br><br>And they like money.<br><br>- They do. They do.<br>- That's the way it works.<br><br>Yeah, so, we'll see.<br><br>Money makes the world<br>go 'round, right?<br><br>- Hey!<br>- Hey!<br><br>How's the wedding stuff going?<br><br>Good. We found a venue,<br><br>we locked down a bunch of<br>vendors... cake, flowers, DJ.<br><br>And I even walked<br>Michael's dogs for him.<br><br>But you hate dogs?<br><br>I know, but he needed a favour.<br><br>So, team Nicole and Michael<br>seems to be working out?<br><br>Oh, I could not have<br>done this without Michael.<br><br>What was that?<br><br>What?<br><br>You just smiled and tucked<br>your hair behind your ear<br><br>when you said Michael.<br><br>You only do that when you<br>like people. You like Michael?<br><br>What? No! No, I don't.<br><br>Don't be weird.<br><br>Me weird? You're weird.<br><br>You're having<br>marshmallows for dinner.<br><br>Okay, don't change the subject.<br><br>Do you<br><br>like<br><br>Michael?<br><br>No, we're just...<br><br>Wedding planning buddies.<br><br>Huh.<br><br>Huh, what?<br><br>Nothing. Just curious.<br><br>You said ""buddies"",<br>not ""friends"".<br><br>So?<br><br>Well, most people would have<br>said ""friends"", not ""buddies"".<br><br>Oh, eat your marshmallows!<br><br>I'm just wondering<br>if you're not trying to<br><br>friend-zone this guy.<br><br>Well, what's wrong<br>with having male friends?<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>So long as it doesn't prevent<br>you from finding a boyfriend.<br><br>Michael's just<br>a really nice guy.<br><br>You just did it again!<br><br>Oh! So?<br><br>But wait, I thought he was<br>trying to get back together<br><br>with his ex?<br><br>Hm. Yes, yes, yes.<br><br>That<br><br>did not work out.<br><br>You like him.<br><br>Ah!<br><br>There you are.<br><br>What are you doing?<br>People are starting to get here.<br><br>Um... Just, um...<br><br>Whoa! Why do you<br>look so nervous?<br><br>I'm fine.<br><br>Wait, is there... Is there a<br>problem I should know about?<br><br>No, I'm good. I'm good.<br><br>Did we forget to order dessert?<br><br>No. Dessert is here.<br><br>So, what's up?<br><br>It's just...<br><br>My family...<br><br>Well, they should<br>be arriving any minute.<br><br>That's the problem!<br><br>I don't do well<br>with family get-togethers.<br><br>At least, not when<br>it's my own family.<br><br>I know family can be difficult.<br><br>They're just, they're<br>so successful. And I'm...<br><br>Amazing.<br><br>Listen, I've had to spend a lot<br>of time with you<br><br>these last few days<br>and you are...<br><br>a really amazing guy.<br><br>You hated me the<br>first time that we met.<br><br>Oh, first impressions<br>don't count.<br><br>Really?<br><br>Well, maybe most of them do,<br>but not this one.<br><br>Seriously, do you not see<br>what a great person you are?<br><br>- Yeah. You know, you're right.<br>- Hm.<br><br>Besides, they're all on their<br>third marriage, anyway,<br><br>so what do they know, right?<br><br>Well, I know that you are<br>the guy who helped me<br><br>pick out a wedding dress<br>the day after I yelled at him.<br><br>True.<br><br>The dress, the cake,<br>the flowers...<br><br>All the things that people<br>are going to really love,<br><br>I mean, that's all you.<br><br>You really helped me.<br>And Kim, by the way,<br><br>through all of this.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>So, let's get out there and<br>give them the old...<br><br>Whap-ah!... one, two punch.<br><br>Ha!<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Go!<br><br>All right. Thank you.<br><br>I'm going to go.<br><br>I will be right behind you.<br><br>Ooh!<br><br>Look out.<br><br>Oh!<br><br>That-a-way!<br><br>Hi.<br><br>You are doing a horrible job<br>at trying to hide.<br><br>Maybe if I go hide<br>in the bathroom?<br><br>They'll find you.<br><br>I meant the bathroom<br>in my apartment.<br><br>See, just go take that wit and<br>humour and go talk to somebody.<br><br>Nope.<br><br>Uhh!<br><br>Well, I've talked to a bunch of<br>your family and they seem nice.<br><br>Hey, Mikey!<br>How the heck are you?<br><br>Uncle Trevor.

Are you sure?<br>It seemed pretty important.<br><br>Is everything okay?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Everything is great.<br><br>Uh, it's just one little,<br><br>teensy, weensy, little...<br><br>detail.<br><br>Okay, great.<br><br>So give me a call<br>tomorrow, all right?<br><br>- Yeah.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>Congrats, Kim.<br><br>And there is my handsome fiancé.<br><br>- Ladies.<br>- Mm.<br><br>Isn't he amazing?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Amazing!<br><br>- Are you sure?<br>- Yes!<br><br>Are you absolutely sure?<br><br>Yes!<br><br>Are you positive, 'cause...<br><br>No. Well, yes!<br><br>I know what I heard.<br><br>Last night your uncle<br>told another woman<br><br>that he loved her.<br><br>But you didn't see this woman?<br><br>Well, he was on the phone.<br><br>But I heard him call her<br>""Honey Bunny.""<br><br>And they talked<br>about secret meetings.<br><br>Come on, Bradley.<br><br>The one uncle<br>I actually looked up to.<br><br>And everybody asks me why<br>I'm so cynical about love.<br><br>I mean, huh!<br><br>This is horrible.<br><br>I will talk to Bradley.<br>You need to tell Kim.<br><br>I know.<br><br>But...<br><br>What?<br><br>But<br><br>she is so happy.<br><br>And our boss, Mr. Banks?<br><br>He seems to be really impressed<br>with all the work I've been...<br><br>We've been doing, putting this<br>wedding together so quickly.<br><br>So?<br><br>Well,<br><br>he alluded to the idea that<br><br>I might be up for a promotion.<br><br>And if I tell Kim now that<br>her fiancé is cheating on her,<br><br>I mean...<br><br>That'll ruin everything.<br><br>Bradley cheating on Kim<br>is ruining everything.<br><br>This isn't on you.<br><br>You're going to put off<br>telling your friend...<br><br>My boss.<br><br>You're not going to tell her<br>because you think<br><br>it might jeopardise<br>your chances at a promotion?<br><br>Nicole.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>I will tell Kim.<br><br>She's my family, after all.<br><br>Wait, Michael...<br><br>It'll just be worse<br>coming from you.<br><br>I'm the one that<br>overheard the call.<br><br>I should be the one to tell her.<br><br>Promise me you won't<br>talk to your uncle?<br><br>Sure. Whatever.<br><br>Just give me a few days and<br>I will figure everything out.<br><br>Look, I get that you're this<br>super-cynical person<br><br>when it comes to<br>romance and marriage.<br><br>And maybe the idea of someone<br>cheating on their fiancé<br><br>days before their wedding<br>is a reason to justify<br><br>- continuing to feel that way.<br>- Michael.<br><br>But for the rest of us,<br>this is important.<br><br>Marriage, romance. Love?<br><br>These things do exist, Nicole,<br><br>whether you want to<br>believe in them or not.<br><br>Or maybe I was right to be<br>skeptical all these years.<br><br>Maybe we live in a world<br>where ""true love""<br><br>just doesn't exist?<br><br>People fall in love, Nicole.<br><br>Yeah, well, prove it.<br><br>Up until five minutes ago<br>I thought<br><br>I was falling in love with you.<br><br>Michael, I...<br><br>I am going to fix this.<br><br>I will tell her. I promise.<br><br>Just give me a few days.<br><br>Cool.<br><br>I'll hold off on talking<br>to Bradley until you tell Kim.<br><br>I really hope you make<br>the right decision, Nicole.<br><br>He said he was in love with you?<br><br>He said he was falling in love<br>with me, but he hadn't fallen.<br><br>And now?<br><br>He's not picking up his phone<br>or answering his texts.<br><br>So what are you going to do?<br><br>I mean, he's right.<br><br>I need to tell Kim.<br><br>But she's so...<br><br>happy.<br><br>And then there's<br>this promotion and...<br><br>I just need some time<br>to work something out.<br><br>Maybe Kim will figure out that<br>Bradley's cheating on her own?<br><br>Nicole...<br><br>I'll figure it out.<br><br>I always do.<br><br>And Michael?<br><br>Well, apparently, he's not<br>my biggest fan right now.<br><br>But there's only a few things<br>left to take care of<br><br>before the wedding and...<br><br>I'll handle them on my own.<br><br>This thing with you and Michael<br><br>stopped being about wedding<br>planning a long time ago.<br><br>He said he was<br>falling in love with you?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Well, it doesn't really matter<br>anymore, does it?<br><br>Unless...<br><br>you were falling for him, too.<br><br>Kim?<br><br>Hi, Mr. Banks.<br><br>Kim...<br><br>Can I talk to you<br>about something, privately,<br><br>for a moment?<br><br>Maybe in your office?<br><br>Perfect timing, Nicole,<br>because there is something<br><br>that I would like to talk<br>to you about, as well.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Look, the thing is I...<br><br>You got the promotion!<br><br>Congratulations.<br><br>You earned this, Nicole.<br><br>Your attention to detail,<br>your meticulous planning,<br><br>your teamwork.<br><br>You have done so much<br>for this company.<br><br>And, on a personal note,<br><br>you've done so much<br>for Bradley and I.<br><br>This wedding is going to be<br>the best day of my life.<br><br>And I owe it all to you.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>I, um...<br><br>I don't know what to say.<br><br>I am so happy right now.<br><br>I'm sorry. What-what is it that<br>you wanted to talk to me about?<br><br>Um...<br><br>It can wait.<br><br>Congratulations.<br><br>Michael.<br><br>I hear you got a promotion.<br><br>Michael, I...<br><br>It's okay. I get it.<br><br>I really wanted to tell Kim.<br><br>But I kept putting it off and<br>putting it off and... uh!<br><br>She is so happy.<br><br>Huh.<br><br>And now, here we are.<br><br>What do I do?<br><br>On the day<br>she's getting married?<br><br>Exactly.<br><br>To a man who's cheating on her.<br><br>Sh-sh-sh! Sh-sh-sh-sh!<br><br>Someone could hear you.<br><br>So long as Kim doesn't,<br>you'll still get your promotion.<br><br>Uh!<br><br>Michael...<br><br>I get that you think<br>I'm this horrible person.<br><br>That's just it. I...<br>I know you're an amazing person.<br><br>You're one of the most<br>amazing people I have ever met.<br><br>That's the problem.<br><br>The problem?<br><br>If you had just been a jerk<br>this whole time and not this<br><br>smart, funny, incredible woman,<br>this wouldn't be so hard.<br><br>What wouldn't be so hard?<br><br>Seeing a really good person<br>make a really bad decision.<br><br>Look, I'm sorry that the...<br><br>The romance gods haven't been<br>kinder to Nicole Waters.<br><br>I really am.<br><br>But I started to think maybe<br>there was a good reason for it.<br><br>Wait. You think<br><br>I've spent all these years<br>having bad luck at love<br><br>for a good reason?<br><br>What reason would that be?<br><br>So you'd still be single by<br>the time we got a chance<br><br>to meet in the park that day.<br><br>I'm going to go check<br>on the reception area.<br><br>Everything here looks to be<br>about as good as it can be.<br><br>You look beautiful.<br><br>Kim!<br><br>You look amazing.<br><br>Thank you. Nicole,<br>this place is beautiful.<br><br>You and Michael did such a<br>great job finding it.<br><br>You deserve it.<br><br>Do you remember my parents,<br>Kathleen and Marvin?<br><br>Of course I do.<br><br>It's nice to see you both again.<br><br>So, how's the<br>wedding area looking?<br><br>They're just putting the<br>finishing touches on it now.<br><br>And the officiant?<br><br>I spoke to him a<br>few minutes ago.<br><br>He should be here any moment.<br><br>And what about<br>the reception area?<br><br>The tent went up last night<br><br>and they're just setting up the<br>tables and place settings.<br><br>Oh! And what about...<br><br>Kim, darling,<br><br>this young lady has<br>everything under control.<br><br>You're right, Mom.<br><br>Nicole,<br><br>thank you so much for<br><br>everything you've done.<br><br>And she will make sure<br><br>nothing bad happens<br>to you today.<br><br>Your mom's right.<br><br>Today is going to be perfect.<br><br>When Kim's mother and I<br>got married,<br><br>we had the service in my<br>parent's backyard.<br><br>My mother and aunts<br>did all the decorations.<br><br>My father grilled steaks for the<br>adults and hotdogs for the kids.<br><br>That sounds amazing.<br><br>Mm, it wasn't much but...<br><br>here we are, almost<br>45 years later...<br><br>Still head over heels in love.<br><br>Really?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Kim hasn't been that lucky yet,<br><br>but let's hope she finds it<br>with Bradley.<br><br>Nicole, darling, that dress<br><br>is so beautiful, and I know<br>you helped pick it out.<br><br>I had some help, actually.<br><br>Marvin, is she not the<br>most beautiful bride<br><br>you have ever seen in your life?<br><br>You mean the second<br>most beautiful bride.<br><br>Aww.<br><br>Actually,<br><br>could I have a moment<br>with Kim?

You all must be starving.<br><br>What's the story, Wahyu?<br><br>Listen. On the way back, in the middle of the woods...<br><br>...our motorcycle suddenly broke down.<br><br>But suddenly, an old man helped us.<br><br>And he invited me and Widya to a party!<br><br>I am so full.<br><br>A party?<br><br>Yes, a party, with lots of food.<br><br>Delicious food.<br><br>And there was...<br><br>...a dancer there.<br><br>She's beyond beautiful!<br><br>Her body looks like a Spanish guitar. I wanted to play her.<br><br>I'm full. It's your loss that you didn't come with me.<br><br>Is there another village in the woods?/ There is!<br><br>Nonsense.<br><br>There isn't!<br><br>As far as I know,<br>this is the only village in the middle of the woods.<br><br>For real, there's another village nearby.<br><br>Yu...<br><br>Mr. Prabu also said the same thing.<br><br>That was what Ilham said too.<br><br>Widya.<br><br>But it was there, right?<br><br>It was there, right, Widya?<br><br>Widya, nod yes.<br><br>Alright.

Ask him yourself.<br><br>Come on, Sherry.<br><br>Okay, I'll ask him<br>on one condition.<br><br>Yeah?<br><br>That I get to eat dinner<br>with you guys<br><br>and none of the other kids<br>get to come.<br><br>Why?

With heavy casualties.<br><br>The attack on hill 1205 however,<br>was a brilliant success.<br><br>Leading elements of the 1st Battalion<br>had gained the summit of the objective.<br><br>Before a strongly entrenched enemy<br>knew that an assault was in progress.<br><br>To the right of 1205, the 3rd Ranger<br>Battalion had captured its objective.<br><br>But only after successive<br>attacks and costly casualties.<br><br>For on 950 the enemy<br>was not taken unaware.<br><br>Counter attacks were to be<br>expected. On both 1205 and 950.<br><br>They were not long developing.<br><br>The fist was launched during<br>the early daylight hours.<br><br>And even as it was beaten off,<br>another took form.<br><br>Day and night, they followed.<br><br>Unremitting violence.<br><br>The toll of enemy dead mounted<br>with each new attempt.<br><br>The German prisoners<br>captured on 1205 and 950.<br><br>Said they had been ordered to<br>retake those positions at all costs.<br><br>In addition to defending<br>hill 1205, the 1st Battalion ..<br><br>Obedient to the field order, undertook<br>the reduction of enemy defenses.<br><br>Which were organized along<br>the ridge running west.<br><br>On the 12th of December ..<br><br>The 1st Battalion was reinforced<br>with the 504th Parachute Battalion.<br><br>Which took over and maintained<br>the defenses of 1205 and 950.<br><br>Thereby enabling the 1st Battalion ..<br><br>To throw its entire remaining strength<br>into the assault along the ridge.<br><br>But the first string had dwindled<br>and shrunk in the five days passed.<br><br>There was now a question if its existing<br>numbers were sufficient to prevail.<br><br>Reports during the night<br>of the 14th December.<br><br>Stated that the enemy was<br>offering bitter resistance.<br><br>And that the issue was in grave doubt.<br><br>Meanwhile, on the olive terraces below.<br><br>The 2nd and 3rd Battalions had twice<br>again attempted to reach their objective.<br><br>Both times they came up against a wall<br>of automatic weapons and artillery fire.<br><br>Volunteer patrols made attempts to reach<br>enemy positions in the new strong points.<br><br>Not a single member of any such<br>patrol ever came back alive.<br><br>Our attacking forces were furnished good<br>aerial cover by allied fighter patrol.<br><br>But now and then, enemy planes slipped<br>through to bomb and strafe our positions.<br><br>Which, to all purposes had remained<br>unchanged .. since the first day.<br><br>To break the deadlock, orders were given<br>for a co?rdinated divisional attack.<br><br>2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 143rd to<br>proceed in the execution of the orders.<br><br>Acting in conjunction, Company A<br>of the 753rd Tank Battalion ..<br><br>To attack San Pietro from<br>the east over the high road.<br><br>1 Battalion of the 141st to attack<br>over the flat valley floor.<br><br>After nightfall on D-day,<br>the 142nd Infantry Regiment ..<br><br>To attack Mount Lungo.<br><br>The earlier decision not to<br>attack those strategic heights.<br><br>Having been reversed in view<br>of the present critical situation.<br><br>In preparation for the attack,<br>all 5th Army artillery within range ..<br><br>Including tanks and all-tracks.<br><br>Was directed against San Pietro.<br><br>And the surrounding area.<br><br>H-hour. 12 hundred hours.<br><br>D-day the 15th of December.<br><br>The 141st Infantry advance some<br>400 yards from its line of departure.<br><br>To be worn down and held powerless<br>under the weight of enemy fire.<br><br>The 2nd and 3rd<br>Battalion of the 143rd ..<br><br>Advanced some 100 yards<br>beyond their former positions.<br><br>To a point almost directly<br>before forward enemy defenses.<br><br>And again they were forced to take such<br>cover as the quaking earth could offer.<br><br>And the tanks.<br><br>Orders were for them to enter the town,<br>locate and destroy heavy weapons there.<br><br>Which were leveled against<br>our attacking foot-soldiers.<br><br>The high road in to San Pietro<br>is a narrow mountain road.<br><br>And from the beginning of its<br>winding decent into Liri Valley ..<br><br>It was under direct enemy observation.<br><br>Sixteen tanks started down that road.<br><br>Three reached the outskirts of the town.<br><br>Of these, two were destroyed<br>and one was missing.<br><br>Five tanks were immobilized<br>behind enemy lines.<br><br>Their crews having to abandon them.<br><br>Five tanks hit enemy<br>mines within our lines.<br><br>And were thereupon<br>destroyed by enemy gunfire.<br><br>Four tanks returned to the bivouac area.<br><br>After dark, two companies.<br><br>One from the 2nd Battalion<br>and one from the 3rd.<br><br>Finally succeeded in penetrating<br>enemy positions before San Pietro.<br><br>But receiving both frontal and flanking<br>fire, they were forced to retire.<br><br>Company E having been reduced<br>in strength to a handful of riflemen.<br><br>And Company L fairing little better.<br><br>On the mount Sammucro ridge ..<br><br>The 1st Battalion fought its way within<br>a hundred yards of the objective.<br><br>But it had paid for ground gained<br>at the rate of a man a yard.<br><br>It did not have the strength to<br>carry the fight any further forward.<br><br>On Mount Lungo however,<br>despite bitter resistance.<br><br>Battalions of the 142nd, in successive<br>waves, kept pushing upwards.<br><br>Until in the early daylight<br>hours of the 16th December.<br><br>Its foot-soldiers had gained the summit.<br><br>And were wiping up what<br>remained of a stubborn enemy.<br><br>And that height proved to be a key<br>position in the enemy plan of defines.<br><br>For even as Mount Lungo fell.<br><br>The enemy, throughout the San Pietro<br>area, made preparations to withdraw.<br><br>Almost invariably the enemy would<br>counter-attack to cover a withdrawal.<br><br>The first violent thrust was<br>delivered within a few hours.<br><br>And thereafter, counter-attacks<br>came in waves.<br><br>The roar of the blasts mingling with<br>the rush and fury of the next to break.<br><br>Many companies lost all their officers.<br><br>Enlisted men came forward<br>as inspirational leaders.<br><br>To rally their battered companies<br>into resisting yet one more onslaught.<br><br>Our artillery was brought to fall within<br>100 yards of our front-line elements.<br><br>After five hours, during which<br>the earth never ceased to tremble.<br><br>The counter-attacks ended.<br><br>Indicating the withdrawal of the<br>enemy's main body had commenced.<br><br>Trying to keep contact with the enemy,<br>our patrols immediately pushed ahead.<br><br>Entering the town they discovered that<br>San Pietro was ours for the taking.<br><br>The 2nd and 3rd Battalions.<br><br>Less than a rifle company in strength.<br><br>Wearied to death, but who were alive.<br><br>Stumbled forward, past San Pietro.<br><br>To consolidate gains and<br>re-establish contact with the enemy.<br><br>Now taking up new positions<br>some five kilometers beyond.<br><br>That is the broad shape<br>of the battle of San Pietro.<br><br>Which was to be the first of<br>many battles in Liri Valley.<br><br>It was a very costly battle.<br><br>After the battle, the 143rd<br>Infantry Regiment alone ..<br><br>Required 1,100 replacements.<br><br>The lives lost were precious lives.<br><br>To their country .. to their loved ones.<br><br>And to the men themselves.<br><br>For the living of the<br>143rd Infantry Regiment ..<br><br>More than 100 decorations for acts of<br>valor above and beyond the call of duty.<br><br>Many among these you see alive here ..<br><br>Have since joined the ranks of their<br>brothers-in-arms who fell at San Pietro.<br><br>For ahead lay San Vittore.<br><br>And the Rapido River and Cassino.<br><br>And beyond Cassino, more<br>rivers and more mountains.<br><br>And more towns, more San Pietros.<br><br>Greater or lesser .. a thousand more.<br><br>As the battle passed over<br>beyond San Pietro, westward.<br><br>Townspeople began to appear, coming<br>out of their caves in the mountains.<br><br>For they had stayed in hiding<br>during the enemy occupation.<br><br>They were mostly old people.<br>And children.<br><br>The townspeople were warned<br>against enemy mines and booby traps.<br><br>Which were in the<br>process of being cleared.<br><br>Children are able to forget quickly.<br><br>Yesterday they wept.<br><br>Today there are smiles<br>and even laughter.<br><br>Tomorrow, it will be as though the<br>bad things had never happened.<br><br>Living was resumed in San Pietro.<br><br>Our prime military aim being to<br>engage and to beat the enemy.<br><br>The capture of the town itself<br>and the liberation of its people.<br><br>Is of an incidental nature.<br><br>But

trap.<br><br>Yeah, we'll cover you.<br><br>It'll be my pleasure, gentlemen<br><br>It's nothin' but a lousy piece of cloth.<br><br>What the hell ?<br><br>Bastard...unbelievable!<br><br>Hey...watch out!<br><br>So...<br><br>you dare to enter Barbarois<br><br>I assume it's arrogance and vast stupidity that brings you here, gentlemen<br><br>or perhaps it's ignorance.<br><br>You're skillful hunters, I can see<br><br>but you're no match for the Barbarois.<br><br>Five thousand years of isolation have made us invincible!<br><br>Huh?<br><br>What?<br><br>What the hell's going on?<br><br>The shadow...<br><br>...watch out for the shadow.<br><br>What're you talking about?<br><br>The shadow...whaddayou mean?<br><br>Hey...Nolt?<br><br>Hey, Nolt, what the hell happened to you,

!<br><br>Oh, God...we're getting close.<br><br>Those...are the windmills of the Barbarois.<br><br>I really wish you'd turn back.<br><br>There must be another way.<br><br>There isn't.<br><br>I am D, the hunter<br><br>I have business with the Barbarois.<br><br>Oh, no.....<br><br>So I see you have dismounted.<br><br>You have respect for your elders.<br><br>That's very considerate indeed.<br><br>I want you to stop your protection of Meier Link.<br><br>You what?<br><br>You know, you make me laugh, that's a good one.<br><br>I see you are a very humorous young man, and beautiful too, I might add.<br><br>Or does that make you uncomfortable, to have an old lech like me admire you so?<br><br>Do you take me for a fool?<br><br>Someone paid me a hundred million dollars to protect Meier Link.<br><br>Can you top that?<br><br>Well, you drive a hard bargain there, old man<br><br>what if I can?<br><br>You really are entertaining me, Mr. Stranger!<br><br>I suppose you know our reputation<br><br>the Barbarois serve the people of the night,<br><br>and after five thousand years, I don't think we're about to change our stripes anytime soon,<br><br>although if we did for anyone it would be for you.<br><br>I have seen many a dhampir,<br><br>but somebody like you I've never seen before.<br><br>That's why it's such a pity that you have to die.<br><br>I really can't let you leave here alive, now, can I?<br><br>I'm afraid you have to die, Stranger.<br><br>So sorry.<br><br>The Barbarois are great warriors.<br><br>You are a warrior too, no doubt<br><br>and although you may kill some of us,<br><br>in the end we will prevail.<br><br>I have sworn to protect the carriage<br><br>prepare to die!<br><br>Fool!<br><br>What's he doin' in there?<br><br>Borgoff, are we ready yet?<br><br>Grove<br><br>we have no choice.<br><br>We need your help on this, Grove.<br><br>Think you can do it there, man?<br><br>Give it to me<br><br>I'm waiting.<br><br>Don't push yourself too hard, now.<br><br>I mean it, OK<br><br>I want you back.<br><br>You know, I really have nothing against the Barbarois personally.<br><br>It's a shame I'll have to kill so many of you.<br><br>Indeed, I admire your loyalty and your devotion to duty.<br><br>Yet I wonder about the fairness when you allow one to fight against so many.<br><br>But...<br><br>if that will entertain you...<br><br>I see.<br><br>you make I see. a good argument, young man<br><br>how interesting.<br><br>Oh, man, I think the fellow is right.<br><br>Please allow the three of us to entertain our young guest here,<br><br>unless he thinks that's unfair<br><br>three against one, how unfair, three against one, unfair...<br><br>That's enough!<br><br>You mock us with your ridiculous antics, Benge.<br><br>I will not have you distracting us from the job at hand, which is the protection of the carriage.<br><br>We'll do things my way...huh?<br><br>What the devil is that?<br><br>Go for it, Grove...go for it!<br><br>Kill all those guys<br><br>kill every last one of 'em!<br><br>Come on, Grove, hold on.<br><br>Get the carriage out now!<br><br>Follow me, Tinkerbell.<br><br>I'm waiting for you!<br><br>Grove!<br><br>I've got to say this<br><br>I admire that young hunter's spirit,<br><br>although he doesn't stand a chance against Benge and the others.<br><br>Still, it's a pity I'll miss the show.<br><br>Oh well, c'est la vie.<br><br>Wake up, D!<br><br>What's wrong with you?<br><br>It's not fair, it's not fair<br><br>I'll show you what's not fair!<br><br>Stay there till you rot, hunter!<br><br>Suckers!<br><br>Stop, I beg you.<br><br>Say goodnight.<br><br>Kyle, did you happen to see where that girl went?<br><br>Maybe she got caught in the wheels.<br><br>Go look.<br><br>Nice, Caroline, very nice.<br><br>A little crude, but effective.<br><br>They're all yours!<br><br>That freakin' monster.<br><br>Is everybody all right?<br><br>Yeah, but Kyle was outside.<br><br>He was up on top.<br><br>Kyle?<br><br>Kyle, where the hell are you, Kyle?<br><br>Down here!<br><br>You OK?<br><br>Quiet! They're still around!<br><br>No!<br><br>Damn! That idiot!<br><br>Well, how convenient this is for me.<br><br>Come on out here so I can finish the job.<br><br>Your time is up.<br><br>Come on, you coward!<br><br>You're gonna pay for the pain you caused my brother.<br><br>D! Are you awake?<br><br>I need your help to swallow up this spell.<br><br>You're a slave driver, you know that?<br><br>Hey, remember to watch out for the shadow, huh?<br><br>Try and stay still.<br><br>Easier said than done.<br><br>And keep your mouth shut.<br><br>That was close...<br><br>Well, the tank is fulla holes.<br><br>Fuel's all gone, we can't drive it like this anyway.<br><br>What're we gonna do?<br><br>What. Should. We. Do?<br><br>Borgoff, any idea?<br><br>How's Grove?<br><br>Honestly, not too great.<br><br>Borgoff, wake up!<br><br>What are you thinking about over there?<br><br>Oh, nothin', really.<br><br>I was just thinkin' about the carriage.<br><br>Wonder where it is by now.<br><br>Well, man, at this point it's pretty much anybody's guess.<br><br>If you want my opinion, I'd say they're either setting sail from the port of Abrol or hiding somewhere deep in the Grenerge Mountain Range.<br><br>I sure hope so.<br><br>Anyway, we still have to get some fuel<br><br>and the town of Garucia isn't that far away from here.<br><br>Kyle, you go with Leila.<br><br>I'll stay here and do the repairs.<br><br>If you are seeking the pathway to the stars, come to me.<br><br>I pray for your safe arrival with all my heart.<br><br>The pathway to the stars....<br><br>I dunno about you, but y'know, I sure miss that horse.<br><br>What was his name?<br><br>Oh...oh, the silent treatment, huh?<br><br>Well, I got two words for you: Heat syndrome.<br><br>Look -- look, I know I'm a parasite, but haven't I always been a helpful parasite?<br><br>You may not care if you die from heat<br><br>but becoming a piece of beef jerky is not a lifelong ambition of mine.<br><br>Yeah, well, what's the sound of one hand yapping...<br><br>How much?<br><br>Oh no -- keep your money.<br><br>C'mon, just take it --<br><br>Let's go.<br><br>Leila?<br><br>Oh. I see.<br><br>It's him, isn't it?<br><br>Kyle, why don't you start back without me.<br><br>There's something I want to do here first.<br><br>Back off.<br><br>Have I told you<br><br>you're quite irresistible in that sexy skin-tight getup?<br><br>No -- tell me about it.<br><br>I just did.<br><br>Make sure you watch your back with that guy, Leila.<br><br>I'd like a beer.<br><br>I've just been admirin' your fancy weapon there.<br><br>Don't worry.<br><br>I have no plans to use it anytime soon.<br><br>That's good.<br><br>That's good, 'cause I have no plans to let you keep it.<br><br>Give it up.<br><br>You heard me, little girl.<br><br>Mm. Thank you.<br><br>Well, here's to ya, Sheriff.<br><br>I'd buy you a drink, but...<br><br>Thank you, but no thanks.<br><br>Oh, OK. I was just gonna say, you must be awfully busy with that new dhampir hunter in the town now.<br><br>What dhampir hunter?<br><br>I'd like to buy that horse.<br><br>Three hundred thousand dollars.<br><br>And if you don't like the price, go somewhere else.<br><br>Freeze! Put your hands where I can see 'em. Now!<br><br>Sheriff, he paid good money for that.<br><br>What are you doing?!<br><br>Take your money and go.<br><br>We don't want you here.<br><br>We don't sell to dhampirs in this town, understand?<br><br>Understand me, dhampir?<br><br>You understand.<br><br>Wait a minute. That's my horse you're talking about there,<br><br>and I'll sell it to whoever I want if they can afford the price I'm asking.<br><br>You can't do that.<br><br>We have laws against it, Polk...good laws, and for a damn good reason.<br><br>What laws?<br><br>Don't play coy, Polk, you know as well as I dhampirs aren't allowed.<br><br>Not allowed, right ...<br><br>I remember a time not that long ago when we had vampires and dhampirs both around here. But...<br><br>And that's why we have the law.<br><br>Listen to me, whether you want to hear it or not...you weren't even born when this happened.<br><br>Do yourself a favor and listen to the story.<br><br>I'm going to tell you about the time when the children were kidnapped.<br><br>There were ten children altogether ...<br><br>Yeah, I heard about that time.<br><br>The kidnappers turned out to be vampires, of course.<br><br>And so the townspeople pooled their money to hire a vampire hunter.<br><br>They wanted the best.<br><br>And when the hunter came...<br><br>he was a very strong and quiet man.<br><br>and he did his job, too, which was to return the children safely back into their parents' homes.<br><br>It wasn't easy, but many vampires died by his hands before this job was over with.<br><br>And when it was over and the children were back home,<br><br>the people attacked the man.<br><br>They said he was a dhampir, half vampire himself...so they punished him.<br><br>Can't say I blame them for doing that.<br><br>You can't trust 'em, that's all that's about.<br><br>They were right about that part, Polk.<br><br>He did the job!<br><br>I see then, I'll have to take matters into my own hands.<br><br>Let him go.<br><br>What is that?<br><br>What does it look like, idiot?<br><br>Put down your guns.<br><br>Polk, you can't know what you're doing ... put it down...<br><br>I know exactly what I'm doing.<br><br>You DON'T know! Put it down now, you old fool!<br><br>I would much rather be an old fool than what you are, Sheriff.<br><br>Now, don't shoot.<br><br>I can tell you I won't think twice about using this weapon.<br><br>I might even enjoy it.<br><br>Get on your horse, Stranger.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>No, it's only fitting I thank you.<br><br>It's the least I can do.<br><br>I may be just an old fool now, Stranger, but I could never forget a face like yours.<br><br>And I'll never forget what you done for me back then.<br><br>That's right...I was one of them kids.<br><br>And I always felt bad about that<br><br>the way you was treated.<br><br>How nobody stopped you, nobody thanked you instead the ignorant bastards ran you right out of our town.<br><br>So it's true, isn't it, what they say about you dhampirs.<br><br>You don't age.<br><br>Now go...I'm getting tired.<br><br>Where's Benge? What's taking him so long?<br><br>Well, the horses are rested now. We'd better go.<br><br>Come on.<br><br>Master, what is it? May I help you, sir?<br><br>It's still light outside, Master!<br><br>What...?<br><br>Leave her alone, Mashira.<br><br>Yes, sir.<br><br>She misses the sunlight. Let her enjoy it.<br><br>I am D, the hunter.<br><br>Your father sent me.<br><br>Don't be afraid...I won't hurt you.<br><br>You sit in the sunlight...you must not be changed.<br><br>So why do you stay with him?<br><br>Last night in the carriage you called out his name.<br><br>Why did you call for him?<br><br>I suppose my father has not told you that I'm in love with Meier.<br><br>You don't know who he is.<br><br>You can't be in love with him.<br><br>Well, I am.<br><br>If you only knew how good he's been to me.<br><br>I love him.<br><br>Please believe me; no one else will.<br><br>You don't understand.<br><br>He is what he is, Charlotte.<br><br>You can't change him; he'll take you in time.<br><br>And when that happens, I will have to kill you.<br><br>Fine; kill me, then.<br><br>I would rather die than to go anywhere without him.<br><br>Don't take me back there...I mean it. I simply could not live without Meier.<br><br>How sweet that is.<br><br>She loves a vampire.<br><br>So very sweet.<br><br>Idiot!<br><br>You stupid girl, get up! We're going.<br><br>Leave me alone!<br><br>You'll do what I say.<br><br>Do you have any idea how many people have died at the hands of your beloved Meier, this vampire you wanna protect!<br><br>None!<br><br>You fool! And you...You stay right where you are, my friend.<br><br>Sorry, but I really don't want to have to share any of my profits.<br><br>You understand, don't you...it's business.<br><br>Above you.<br><br>What's wrong? Tell me!<br><br>Too much sun.<br><br>I warned you about the heat, but you don't listen!<br><br>Come on. You can't survive unless you dig a hole. You need to bury yourself!<br><br>Hurry!<br><br>Leila! Leila, are you there? Come in, Leila.<br><br>Yeah, I copy.<br><br>Thank God. Are you OK? What's your position?<br><br>I'm near Lake Chiffon. Our game is heading north from here.<br><br>We'll catch up.<br><br>Leila, do you know what's happened to the dhampir hunter?<br><br>No; I haven't seen him.<br><br>All right. Well, take care.<br><br>Stay in touch. Borgoff out.<br><br>The tables have turned.<br><br>Now, that cleared my head.<br><br>I really should return the favor, don't you think, honey?<br><br>Don't get any ideas.<br><br>Hey, I'm just trying to stay dry here.<br><br>If there was any other place to go, believe me, I'd be there.<br><br>As soon as the rain lets up, I'll be gone from here and from you.<br><br>I think I can guess your problem.<br><br>Your family was the victim of vampires.<br><br>You don't know what you're talking about.<br><br>You don't know anything about it.<br><br>All right. Perhaps I don't.<br><br>This stupid thing...it bothers me.<br><br>You really are a weird one, you know that?<br><br>In spite of being a dhampir hunter and all that that entails.<br><br>How did you know about my mother?<br><br>You called her name, remember?<br><br>She was kidnapped by vampires.<br><br>My father went after her and was trying to rescue her ... so they killed him.<br><br>And after a while my mother returned, but she wasn't my mother any more<br><br>she'd been changed.<br><br>The people in the village stoned her to death while I watched.<br><br>After that I left home.<br><br>I met the Markus brothers and joined with them.<br><br>I wanted to be a hunter to avenge my parents' deaths.<br><br>I've seen many terrible things since then, lives destroyed, families devastated, hopes crushed...<br><br>every time, it seems ... vampire is to blame.<br><br>I can understand why you'd choose to do it, but the life of a hunter is no kind of life.<br><br>It's the only life I'm any good for now, and it looks like it's the only life you've ever known.<br><br>So I suggest we make a pact.<br><br>Since we're both in it for the long haul, whoever dies first, the other one can come and bring flowers to their grave.<br><br>How's that?<br><br>It's the rain<br><br>makes me sentimental.<br><br>I don't know why I should care about that...it's just I love flowers.<br><br>And I don't think I'll be getting any...<br><br>I'm all alone, after all.<br><br>We have that much in common, don't we.<br><br>That we're both hunters and we're both alone.<br><br>Oh well, I'm being silly...doesn't really matter<br><br>I'll do it.<br><br>I'll bring you flowers if I survive this...but I don't expect to.<br><br>Stop, I didn't really mean it when I said that.<br><br>And anyway, I don't really understand why you should keep on doing this.<br><br>Because I'm a dhampir.<br><br>I don't get to have a life; not like you.<br><br>Well, with the rainstorm last night, they can't be too far away.<br><br>We're even now, dhampir...understand?<br><br>I have a very bad feeling about this.<br><br>How so?<br><br>I think I've finally figured it out, Borgoff.<br><br>Well, I'm sure you're right...if you're thinking they're headed for the castle.<br><br>Yeah, that's right, the castle...the Castle of Chaythe!<br><br>WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, WE CAN'T GO IN THERE, IT WOULD BE SUICIDE!<br><br>What are you now, afraid of a little insanity?<br><br>Since when have we been sane?<br><br>We just have to get to them before they reach the castle.<br><br>There's a bridge up ahead...that's where we intercept the carriage.<br><br>I remember that trick from the time we got those vampires at Keldo.<br><br>Yeah, it worked that time, and it can work again now.<br><br>Leila, come in; come in, Leila.

I won't hear it.<br><br>Leila...what do you think?<br><br>Grove, they fear us.<br><br>They fear us because they know our reputation. That we never give up.<br><br>And we never can.<br><br>If we quit now, we might as well quit the business, and I can't do that.<br><br>I won't do it...till every last one of them is gone.<br><br>Master...do you hear?<br><br>He is coming.<br><br>The castle is nearby.<br><br>I'll stay here and deal with him.<br><br>Getting close. The Castle of Chaythe.<br><br>Soon we'll be able to see it<br><br>the home of Carmila, the Bloody Countess.<br><br>You've heard of her.<br><br>For five thousand years her rule of terror lasted, and then, that was that!<br><br>Your father, the vampire king, grew angry.<br><br>He was impatient with her vanity; offended by her bloodlust, her gluttony.<br><br>He grew so tired that he killed her while she slept, impaling her on a sword, and that was it for her.<br><br>Except she haunts the place now with phantoms and demons, but you don't care about that, do you?<br><br>But I bet I know what really gets to you, dhampir<br><br>what REALLY gets to you<br><br>the thought of those two lovebirds giving birth to another dhampir, huh?<br><br>That's it.<br><br>You see, I know you; I know how you think, I know how you feel, I know every move that you make, you can't...<br><br>I'm glad we could meet at last, Hunter D.<br><br>You are a worthy opponent.<br><br>Who hired the Barbarois?<br><br>Who were you working for?<br><br>It was Carmila who hired us.<br><br>And as a Barbarois, my duty has been fulfilled.<br><br>Now I can die in peace.<br><br>I gather from your letter that you had a rather difficult time.<br><br>I think I can understand what it's like.<br><br>Love is not unique to humans, you know<br><br>we vampires are very susceptible.<br><br>I hope I can be of service.<br><br>We're very grateful, Carmila.<br><br>You both must be exhausted.<br><br>Perhaps you should rest first.<br><br>I'm sure that the young lady would like to freshen up.<br><br>You've probably heard rumors about me, but I can assure you, they all stem from jealousy and envy.<br><br>I'm not the ""Bloody Carmila"" they like to portray me as.<br><br>Now, behold...<br><br>That's it; that is the ship.<br><br>It will take you to the city of the night where you can live peacefully at last.<br><br>You can be happy there.<br><br>There was a time, many years ago, when every castle had a ship like this one and the night sky was full of their flashing lights.<br><br>Those were the days when vampires flourished and a love like yours was not so desperately impossible.<br><br>So different from today.<br><br>Our numbers dwindling, hunted and alone, we're hopelessly misunderstood<br><br>but you two seem to have beaten the odds.<br><br>I'm very very happy for you.<br><br>The ship hasn't been used in years.<br><br>I've no idea if it will fly safely, but I'm sure that's a risk you're prepared to take.<br><br>We're very grateful.<br><br>I only wish I could go with you.<br><br>You look so beautiful.<br><br>Why stop? I want you, Meier. I want all of you.<br><br>Why not?<br><br>You don't know what it's like, Charlotte<br><br>to live forever in darkness eternal, forever thirsting for blood despite your best intention.<br><br>I can't imagine that life for you; not for you, Charlotte.<br><br>You're so selfish, Meier.<br><br>I carry a heavy weight on my conscience.<br><br>Those villagers and the bounty hunter and my family...they still mourn my loss, Meier.<br><br>It wasn't your doing, Charlotte.<br><br>It was my fault entirely.<br><br>Well, then we're both to blame, because we can't know happiness; not anymore.<br><br>I wanted you to be happy, Meier, and so I abandoned my father and my brother for you.<br><br>But their pain set the wheels in motion for our pain, and so on and on it goes.<br><br>All we have is each other now, and I want to be close to you.<br><br>Without that we have nothing.<br><br>All the pain I've caused and all the agony I feel is nothing now!<br><br>And you are everything to me, my love.<br><br>We'll talk more on our trip to the stars, if that's all right with you.<br><br>There is some unfinished business I have to attend to.<br><br>Do not leave this room, understand?<br><br>D.<br><br>Listen, Meier. The woman says she wants to go back home.<br><br>I don't ... believe it.<br><br>Charlotte....<br><br>I dunno, something's not right.<br><br>'Course, ah, you don't have to take my word for it<br><br>you can judge for yourself.<br><br>Let's go!<br><br>Leila, don't go.<br><br>Leila, don't go in there.<br><br>If you go in there, you're never coming back!<br><br>Oh, I'm coming back.<br><br>No!<br><br>Leila, check upstairs.<br><br>I'm on it.<br><br>Nice hat.<br><br>I know you hate me, D.<br><br>Please try and understand.<br><br>I loved your father.<br><br>What choice did I have?<br><br>Nolt, Kyle<br><br>hey, I don't believe it!<br><br>You two sure are a sight for sore eyes!<br><br>What are you doing? Get up!<br><br>Why aren't you listening...I said get up!<br><br>Go away.<br><br>Get out of here!<br><br>Can you forgive me, D?<br><br>D?<br><br>I know it's been lonely for you.<br><br>I was lonely too<br><br>until you came along.<br><br>Did you hear? D?<br><br>It's OK, honey<br><br>it's OK to cry.<br><br>I know ... I know how you feel.<br><br>It wasn't your fault. It wasn't.<br><br>Yes it was!<br><br>Let go!<br><br>It's just an illusion.<br><br>Carmila's playing with us.<br><br>Excellent...what fun!<br><br>I haven't had this much fun in centuries!<br><br>You don't mind, do you?<br><br>It just makes things so much more interesting.<br><br>You're doing very well, by the way very well indeed.<br><br>The woman...where are you hiding her?<br><br>Borgoff...what are you doing! We don't have time for this!<br><br>Leila -- are you in love with this dhampir?<br><br>Are you crazy? What is wrong with you<br><br>Borgoff!<br><br>Dhampir<br><br>drop your weapon.<br><br>Drop it now!<br><br>She took you in, didn't she?<br><br>She'll die! I'm warning you, dhampir, don't come any closer.<br><br>Enough! Now you die<br><br>Grove!<br><br>Grove, no!<br><br>Lei ... la ...<br><br>Look...she's coming...Carmila.<br><br>The spirit of Carmila!<br><br>Dhampir hunter...your mother was human, but your father was a vampire, and you're betraying his ancient blood.<br><br>You side with humans against us.<br><br>Your people are facing extinction, and you're contributing to their demise.<br><br>You stalk and kill your own ancestors, dhampir<br><br>YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED!<br><br>Your human self is your weaker self.<br><br>Humans are nothing more than livestock.<br><br>We prey on them as they prey on beasts.<br><br>This is the rule of nature!<br><br>Your time is coming to an end.<br><br>Your kind must face extinction.<br><br>You cannot survive; you must die.<br><br>That is the rule of nature.<br><br>Ah...very strong words for a dhampir.<br><br>But you seem to forget...our spirits are eternal.<br><br>No, Carmila; nothing lasts forever.<br><br>I see.<br><br>I should have known better than to reason with your kind, dhampir hunter.<br><br>I guess my only option is to use force.<br><br>No...this can't happen!<br><br>Are you the son of the vampire king?<br><br>Who are you? Who are you, dhampir?<br><br>Such power...!<br><br>Charlotte, come back. I need you; please come back.<br><br>Darling, is that you?<br><br>Oh yes. It's me...Meier.<br><br>I'm so happy, Meier, because we are together now. At last.<br><br>Together. At last.<br><br>You made me happy, Meier.<br><br>You let me dream. You let me dream of our beautiful trip to the stars.<br><br>Our dream.<br><br>Our beautiful, wonderful dream.<br><br>It's not a dream. We are going to those stars, Charlotte.<br><br>Oh, my dear one.<br><br>You and I will get away from here.<br><br>We will fly together to the city of the night where we were meant to be free from all of this<br><br>where you can rest, my love, finally, and be free.<br><br>Yes...freedom! At last....<br><br>My precious, precious love.<br><br>Let's go...away from here.<br><br>Stop right there, Meier.<br><br>I'm taking her back...back to her family who loved her.<br><br>She knew I loved her best of all.<br><br>You can't understand it. You've never loved a human.<br><br>I've never killed one, either.<br><br>You struggle to resist this nature of ours, but it can't last forever, D.<br><br>The urge for their blood is stronger.<br><br>If that day comes, then another will hunt me.<br><br>It's as simple as that.<br><br>What a waste. What a sad waste.<br><br>Enough of killing. Enough of misery and death.<br><br>I've had enough.<br><br>I've ... had enough!<br><br>Why ... did you miss ... my heart?<br><br>She's dead. The ring is all I need.<br><br>I'll take it to her father.<br><br>As proof.<br><br>Mind giving me a ride just as far as the next town?<br><br>I'd appreciate it.<br><br>That reward money would rightfully be mine, y'know.<br><br>But hey, I'm generous.<br><br>I'll let you keep it just this one time.<br><br>Where is he taking her?<br><br>Away from here.<br><br>Away<br><br>Fly, COME ON!<br><br>You can make it<br><br>come on!<br><br>Fly away ...<br><br>Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in this resting place to bid farewell to our sister.<br><br>Into your gentle arms we commend her gracious spirit.<br><br>Take her to yourself and give her safe haven.<br><br>And though she struggled in life, now she knows your blessed peace.<br><br>For all who question will find answers,<br><br>and all who love will find contentment, joy, and peace eternal.<br><br>For now we see as through a glass darkly,<br><br>but then we shall see clearly, face to face.<br><br>Mister!<br><br>Wait!<br><br>Mister, WAIT!<br><br>excuse me, sir, but...I was wondering if you knew my grandmother Leila.<br><br>Yes ... it's you, isn't it.<br><br>My grandmother told me about you,<br><br>so...I'd be honored if you'd come to our house, my dad would be so happy<br><br>please?<br><br>I appreciate your kindness.<br><br>Oh, c'mon.

William S. Burroughs: A Man Within (2010) - full transcript,"William S. Burroughs: featuring never before seen footage as well as exclusive interviews with his closest friends and colleagues. Born the heir of the Burroughs' adding machine estate, he struggled throughout his life with addiction, control systems, and self. He was forced to deal with the tragedy of killing his wife and the repercussions of neglecting his son. His novel, Naked Lunch, was one of the last books to be banned by the U.S. government. Allen Ginsberg and Norman Mailer testified on behalf of the book. The courts eventually overturned their decision in 1966, ruling that the book had an important social value. It remains one of the most recognized literary works of the 20th century. William Burroughs was one of the first to cross the dangerous boundaries of queer and drug culture in the 1950s, and write about his experiences. Eventually he was hailed the godfather of the beat generation and influenced artists for generations to come. However, his friends were left wondering, did William ever find happiness? This extremely personal documentary breaks the surface of the troubled and brilliant world of one of the greatest authors of all time. ""William S. Burroughs: A Man Within"" is the first and only posthumous documentary about this legendary figure.","<div class=""full-script"">

Go on...<br><br>Oh, my God.<br><br>And I have to take<br>Burroughs and Warhol<br>as parallel figures.<br><br>Two people who,<br>in the late '50s<br>and early '60s,<br><br>stood up for<br>what they believed in.<br><br>Made no pretense about it.<br>Were totally out front about it.<br><br>At that time, that was<br>absolutely outrageous.<br><br>I mean, it's hard for people<br>who didn't live in those times<br>to know.<br><br>When I moved to America<br>in 1965,<br><br>you could not mention<br>the word ""homosexuality""...<br><br>without everyone thinking<br>you were gay.<br><br>And it was really<br>just verboten.<br><br>And it's because of Burroughs<br>and Warhol and what followed<br>in their wake...<br><br>that the whole gay liberation<br>movement sprung up.<br><br>William's boyfriends were<br>a series of obsessions,<br><br>usually more or less foredoomed.<br><br>Well, first of all, his cousin,<br><br>Prynne Hoxie in St. Louis,<br><br>who went off to a different<br>university, Princeton,<br><br>and then died<br>a year and a half later...<br><br>in a drunken accident<br>in New York.<br><br>He was decapitated by...<br>a tunnel.<br><br>And then<br>he fell in love with a boy<br>at Los Alamos Ranch School.<br><br>And there was a big disgrace,<br>and little Billy ran away home<br>to St. Louis...<br><br>and couldn't go back<br>Los Alamos at all.<br><br>Sent off for his diaries.<br>And as he wrote,<br><br>when the box arrived with<br>the fearful diaries in them,<br><br>he couldn't wait to rip it open<br>and make sure he could destroy<br>the offending pages.<br><br>Some of these things<br>were examples of how<br>he had tried to write...<br><br>and why he had given up.<br><br>He says, ""Fact is,<br>I had gotten a 'sickener.'""<br><br>Meaning like a jail sentence.<br><br>I mean, his boyfriends<br>like Jack Anderson,<br><br>the one that he cut<br>his finger off over...<br><br>and who helped him wreck<br>the family car.<br><br>Lewis Marker, the American<br>student at Mexico City College,<br><br>who was probably pretty<br>good intellectual company,<br><br>but was not gonna commit<br>his life to Bill Burroughs.<br><br>So he very much was thinking<br>of boyfriends as members of<br>a class different from him.<br><br>After I had lived with William<br>for several weeks...<br><br>and then began my relationship<br>with Richard Elovich,<br>my first lover,<br><br>I remember William<br>commenting once,<br><br>""See, you and Richard,<br>you have this idea<br>about, uh,<br><br>intellectual and social equals<br>being a couple.""<br><br>He says, ""In my day,<br>that's just unheard of.""<br><br>I mean, you know,<br>it was an interclass thing.""<br><br>In the fall of '89,<br><br>I met him at his old place...<br>his old stomping grounds<br>in the Bowery... the Bunker.<br><br>And at that time, I was 18.<br>I was a freshman in college.<br><br>I was already basically<br>Allen Ginsberg's boyfriend.<br><br>Um, but I always kind of planned<br>out that I would still hook up<br>with William...<br><br>when and if the opportunity<br>presented itself.<br><br>Were you sexually interested<br>in me at that time?<br><br>Uh, I don't...<br>Not particularly.<br><br>Because I don't<br>remember any...<br>I don't remember any, um...<br><br>any such thing.<br>Mm-hmm.<br><br>How come?<br>'Cause I was kind of cute.<br><br>Looking back<br>with hindsight.<br>Well, I don't know.<br><br>If it was<br>like an ordinary<br>relationship...<br><br>in one of his novels,<br><br>it was usually<br>the theme<br>of, um,<br><br>chasing after somebody<br>that didn't quite...<br><br>want to have anything<br>to do with...<br><br>the author of<br>what you were reading.<br><br>Which was, I think in Queer,<br><br>something that was shown<br>like what his writings<br>were for.<br><br>They were love letters<br>to make the person that<br>he was interested in laugh.<br><br>'Cause they were<br>almost comedy routines.<br><br>In a way, he was somebody who<br>appeared to be incredibly sad...<br><br>to me as time went by.<br><br>Someone who'd been hurt.<br><br>For example, you read...<br><br>that William was crazy in love<br>with Allen Ginsberg...<br><br>and that it was almost always<br>an unrequited passion.<br><br>And I think that that<br>disappointment that he had...<br><br>when he did fall in love,<br>which was so rare for him,<br><br>made him a lot<br>more withdrawn...<br><br>sexually and emotionally.<br><br>A lot more afraid of being<br>vulnerable and then being hurt.<br><br>So he started to close down<br>quite a lot, emotionally.<br><br>Do you want to be loved?<br>Mmm, not really.<br><br>It depends...<br>Mm-hmm.<br><br>By who or what.<br>Yeah. Mm-hmm.<br><br>By my cat, certainly.<br><br>Mm-hmm.<br><br>There was something essentially<br>alien about William,<br><br>and I think when it<br>came to his physicality<br>and his romantic life,<br><br>he was one of the most<br>awkward people in the world.<br><br>While there was this<br>facade of a gentleman,<br><br>there was a very<br>lonely man underneath<br>that three-piece suit.<br><br>And it was only once that<br>I really heard him speak<br>of someone...<br><br>he was genuinely interested<br>and obsessed with, Mark Ewert,<br><br>who he described as,<br>""A young man having skin<br>like alabaster.""<br><br>One night I was, like, you know,<br>I should tell this guy<br>I love him, right?<br><br>It was late at night,<br><br>and I wasn't quite sure if<br>he'd already fallen asleep<br>for the night or not.<br><br>So I kind of nudged him,<br>and said, ""William. William.""<br><br>- ""William. William.""<br>- ""Yeah?""<br><br>I said, ""William, I love you.<br>I love you, William.""<br><br>He said, ""Huh?<br>You love women?""<br><br>I said, ""No, no.<br>I love you, William.""<br><br>And what did he say back?<br><br>He was like,<br>""Oh. That's okay.""<br><br>Or something like that.<br>And kind of patted me.<br><br>But then the question is,<br>what did he feel towards me,<br><br>or what did he feel towards<br>other human beings in general?<br><br>I remember reading<br>this interview with him.<br><br>He was talking about<br>nuclear war.<br><br>And he said that,<br>all of a sudden,<br>he just starting sobbing.<br><br>Which, first of all,<br>it was really hard for me<br>to picture him sobbing, period.<br><br>What he was sobbing about is,<br>he said he'd all of a sudden<br>been thinking about nuclear war,<br><br>and then he was struck with<br>this horrific thought of,<br><br>""What would happen to my cats,<br>my six cats, if I died?""<br><br>And that just wrecked him.<br><br>You can just see the cats<br>were kind of these pure,<br>spirit beings for him.<br><br>And I remember some of<br>our very first conversations...<br><br>the first night<br>I met him were about<br>endangered species,<br><br>and about lemurs<br>that he was really into.<br><br>And I think it was... That<br>was just a really safe place<br>for his love to flow.<br><br>And I don't think that meant...<br>I don't think that...<br><br>So like his animals<br>and his cats and these lemurs.<br><br>I don't think that means<br>that that love was false,<br><br>but I definitely<br>had the sense...<br><br>that it was all<br>kind of flowing in this<br>fairly narrow channel...<br><br>that would probably<br>have been too hard for him,<br>in this lifetime,<br><br>to show for other people.<br><br>And I hope in whatever his<br>next lifetime is nowadays...<br><br>that it's easier for him,<br>and it's not so threatening.<br><br>All right.<br>All right, you two.<br><br>I'll get you some food.<br><br>On one side, he's<br>this kind of...<br><br>loosey-goosey liberal<br>of his time,<br><br>where sexuality is free-spirited<br>and all that sort of thing.<br><br>I don't think he engaged<br>in that all that comfortably.<br><br>I think he had conflict around<br>his sexual orientation.<br><br>I don't think that<br>was always clear to him.<br><br>I think he struggled<br>with homophobia, like<br>lots of people his age.<br><br>There are areas of his life that<br>he himself never understood.<br><br>Quite clearly a number<br>of things happened to him<br>when he was very little.<br><br>He was possibly abused<br>by his nanny's boyfriend,<br>and things like this.<br><br>And he spent a lot of time<br>in psychoanalysis trying to<br>find out about these things.<br><br>But, um...<br>And he has talked about it,<br>but it's just too deeply buried.<br><br>He was never really able<br>to find out.<br><br>We first met him in the '70s.<br><br>He was living in London,<br><br>and it was an Irish hustler<br>called John...<br><br>who was sharing<br>the apartment with him,<br><br>who used to hang out<br>in Piccadilly, you know, um,<br><br>doing something or other<br>sexually to get money.<br><br>And William always<br>seemed to prefer...<br><br>young hustlers,<br><br>because there was no need<br>for an emotional attachment.<br><br>There was no danger<br>of being embroiled...<br><br>beyond a controllable point.<br><br>So I think that was one of<br>the reasons that he began to,<br><br>almost exclusively,<br><br>look for sexual pleasure<br>amongst professional,<br>young hustlers.<br><br>There was too much<br>fear of pain...<br><br>to go into a relationship<br>form of love.<br><br>William had a very uneasy<br>relationship with women...<br><br>in the sense that there<br>weren't too many women around.<br><br>But I felt that I had a very<br>nice relationship with him,<br><br>and maybe it was because<br>we really weren't<br>gender identified...<br><br>when we were together.<br><br>Uh, we traded recipes.<br><br>But I would say that<br>in that world,<br><br>particularly if you're,<br>you know, at the Bunker...<br><br>and you're going<br>into the bathroom...<br><br>and you're looking at<br>Keith Haring's drawing<br>of the penis...<br><br>It's not the world<br>that you would expect.<br><br>I had the biggest crush<br>on William.<br><br>Really a big one.<br><br>And I used to even daydream<br>about, you know,<br><br>he would fall in love with me<br>and we would get married.<br><br>I mean, I had a huge crush<br>on William, so...<br><br>And he knew it too,<br>and it didn't bother him at all.<br><br>When the two of us<br>were alone, he'd say,<br><br>""Well, my dear,<br>it's the end of the night.<br><br>Let's hear a little<br>'Bobby Shafto, '""<br><br>And I would sing him<br>the little song.<br><br>* Bobby Shafto's gone to sea<br><br>* Silver buckles on his knee<br><br>* One fine day he'll marry me *<br><br>* Pretty Bobby Shafto *<br><br>Ah, there was another one.<br><br>* Oh, dear,<br>what can the matter be?

troubled life.<br><br>Despite William's conflicting<br>stories about the incident,<br><br>he managed to leave Mexico<br>and never went to prison.<br><br>Of Joan,<br>Burroughs later

and...<br><br>predicated on the idea<br>that you could fix it,<br><br>that you had the power<br>to fix it.<br><br>One of his most<br>extraordinary pieces...<br><br>is that introduction to Queer.<br><br>Because he said those things<br>often here,<br><br>like, in the passing<br>of the decades,<br><br>sort of drunk and alone.<br><br>And he'd talk about it<br>in terms of something<br>that had happened...<br><br>at the moment<br>of synchronicity...<br>something happening...<br><br>and causing you to have<br>a reaction and you don't<br>know what it is.<br><br>And he often talked about<br>how, in Mexico City,<br><br>he was walking down the street<br>and he started crying.<br><br>You know, William<br>was very tough.<br><br>He'd cry for 10 seconds.<br><br>And then continued walking<br>along those winding streets<br>in old Mexico.<br><br>And it happened<br>three or four times.<br><br>He was walking to meet Joan<br>at 5:00 in that bar,<br><br>and he didn't know<br>why he was crying.<br><br>And only after,<br>when she was dead,<br>he remembers this.<br><br>And the idea is that<br>you put your mind...<br><br>It's a synchronicity<br>or whatever that your mind...<br><br>foresees or sees this thing<br>that's happening<br>in the immediate future...<br><br>and you're reacting to it,<br>you're weeping for<br>the horror of it.<br><br>**<br><br>I have constrained myself...<br><br>I have constrained myself...<br><br>to the realization that...<br><br>Toward the end of his life,<br><br>we all gathered and we all<br>performed for him.<br><br>And I decided to read from<br>the introduction to Queer.<br><br>And I was reading it,<br>very concentrative.<br><br>And I tend to improvise<br>when I read.<br><br>So in reading something<br>so intimate of his,<br><br>I was also aware that he<br>would be fully concentrating...<br><br>on how I would read it...<br><br>and what I might<br>discover within it.<br><br>And all of a sudden,<br>I just went off.<br><br>It's like my tongue was tied,<br><br>and I just started<br>babbling a bit.<br><br>I miscalculated.<br><br>It was just a few minutes<br>or a few...<br><br>just microseconds...<br>just...<br><br>And when I finished,<br>everybody was...<br><br>You know, it was mo...<br>just a split second<br>of total silence...<br><br>'cause it was sort of<br>a heavy moment.<br><br>And then I finished.<br><br>And afterwards,<br>I went up to William.<br><br>I didn't know whether<br>to apologize or...<br><br>I didn't know what to say.<br><br>And he just took my hand,<br>and his eyes looked<br>almost teary,<br><br>and he just said, ""Thank you.""<br><br>So I would...<br><br>You know, it's like<br>hypnotizing someone.<br><br>I just feel that<br>if William had any<br>question in his mind...<br><br>whether it was an accident,<br><br>that whatever I channeled...<br>whether it be from the air...<br><br>or be from William himself...<br><br>um, helped to set that at rest.<br><br>The negativity of that karma<br>propelled him to be a writer.<br><br>He had to, you know,<br><br>fight his way out of<br>a black paper bag...<br><br>It was becoming a writer...<br>Of the negative karma<br>that he...<br><br>'Cause he loved Joan.<br>He's a gay man,<br><br>but he had a wife<br>and he loved her.<br><br>They had many... a great...<br>a great life together.<br><br>And it was<br>a great tragedy for him.<br><br>I don't think that you have<br>an accident like that...<br><br>that doesn't mark you<br>for life...<br><br>mark what it means<br>to hold a gun,<br><br>mark what it means<br>to play around with it...<br><br>when you've done that.<br><br>Now, I'm sure that<br>that accident...<br><br>haunted him, for sure.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>After killing his wife,<br><br>William Burroughs moved<br>to Tangier, Morocco,<br><br>where he struggled<br>with his heroin addiction.<br><br>There, in the form of notes,<br>journal entries...<br><br>and letters to Allen Ginsberg<br>and Jack Kerouac,<br><br>he excavated the literature<br>that would become the novel<br>Naked Lunch.<br><br>You know, Burroughs is a fairly<br>foreboding character<br>in

<br><br>How is it going?<br><br>To overcome diseases, like cancer and AIDS...<br><br>...how about changing the human composition on a cellular level?<br><br>That's the basis of this research project.<br><br>First, Level 1 is to improve cell immunity.<br><br>To completely remove all germs...<br><br>He's taking food and enzymes.<br><br>Level 2...<br><br>Using an artificial womb, the cells are re-inforced.<br><br>That's all for now.<br><br>But all that can do is prevent disease, right?<br><br>What about hereditary or already diseased cells?<br><br>The cell will be restored to it's original state.<br><br>When using particle surgery...<br><br>...one must proceed carefully.<br><br>This is Level 3.<br><br>However, there is a high chance that this project will succeed!<br><br>Yes. I'm certain you know the reason why.<br><br>We have two of the best minds in the field of clinical pathology!<br><br>Kazamatsuri Daimon and Onizuka Giichi.<br><br>These two professors are the leaders of this project!<br><br>Hey. What is it?<br><br>Umm... well...<br><br>I asked what is it?<br><br>Understood. Okay.<br><br>How many times to I have to repeat myself, Onizuka?<br><br>Currently, it's not possible to have a live test of Level 3! It's too dangerous!<br><br>I know it's dangerous!<br><br>For medicine and science...<br><br>This is a challenge, Kazamatsuri!<br><br>A challenge?<br><br>Yes...<br><br>A challenge against God!<br><br>And now is the time for our victory!<br><br>You!<br><br>Scientific advances always require things like this.<br><br>Is your only reason ""because I said so?""<br><br>Well...<br><br>Of course, his cells are healthy.<br><br>He has no need for Level 3 treatment.<br><br>But it's needed for this project!<br><br>We need to know how much the cells can endure!<br><br>But...<br><br>Looks like we made a mistake when choosing the test subject.<br><br>Father, don't worry about me.<br><br>You, be quiet!<br><br>Let's take a break.<br><br>We're not monkeys.<br><br>I've got no intention of being on display!<br><br>Okay, everyone.

It's no big deal.<br><br>What?<br><br>No... nothing.<br><br>All paths haves been cut off.<br><br>What's the big deal over a bunch of stabbings?<br><br>It's just business.<br><br>Is it the police?

Just what are you planning?!<br><br>What are you trying to do? How long have you been there?<br><br>Onizuka is dead.<br><br>What?!<br><br>You're the only one who can create a new sample, Professor Kazamatsuri.<br><br>You will co-operate, even if you don't want to...<br><br>...with our organization.<br><br>Politics...<br><br>Thought...<br><br>Culture...<br><br>Economics, and even science.<br><br>Basically everything that is important in society...<br><br>...the organization has influence in.<br><br>That is the nature of the organization, Shin.<br><br>The research is just one part of it.<br><br>You understand, right?<br><br>It's different than what they've been telling everyone.<br><br>They're creating monsters, right?<br><br>They're creating soldiers. Cyborg soldiers.<br><br>Cyborg soldiers?<br><br>They serve as a source of funds for our organization.<br><br>Soldiers can be used as guerilla commanders.<br><br>At first, the organization was after Level 2.<br><br>When added to an android, it would create the ultimate living weapon.<br><br>You saw it, didn't you, Shin?!<br><br>It has a better system,<br><br>more intelligence,<br><br>and much higher power!<br><br>Inevitably, development began on Level 3.<br><br>Instead of re-modelling the cells...<br><br>...we create new ones.<br><br>As it sounds, it is a challenge against God.<br><br>To do that, we invited the best in this field.<br><br>But...<br><br>Onizuka realised the research was different from what was planned.<br><br>He focused on grasshoppers...<br><br>That was wonderful!<br><br>That was good.<br><br>But... then there was that.<br><br>He used his own body, and remodelled his cells... no... created new cells.<br><br>A combination of grasshopper and human.<br><br>My god...<br><br>A mad advancement in science.<br><br>The organization tolerated the escalation of this.<br><br>If successful, he would be the ultimate sample. That was his conclusion.<br><br>I can't believe he performed Level 3 on himself...<br><br>...all just to take data.<br><br>All the while doing the same thing to Shin's body, without us knowing...<br><br>If I had realised...<br><br>You wouldn't have to suffer like this, Shin!<br><br>I...It's my fault!<br><br>A combination of grasshopper and human?<br><br>I see.<br><br>So that's what this is.<br><br>Telepathy. It is able to convey all sorts of things.<br><br>Joy...<br><br>Sadness...<br><br>Fear...<br><br>Pain...<br><br>They can even detect damage to the body that cannot be seen.<br><br>Their shared experience allows them to unify!<br><br>I...<br><br>I...<br><br>What will I do now?<br><br>Return to the lab.<br><br>It'll be okay. Don't worry.<br><br>We'll return your body to normal, Shin. This is the fastest way!<br><br>You understand, right?<br><br>Hey. That's right.<br><br>My job was monitor you, Shin.<br><br>But...<br><br>But now...<br><br>If you don't believe me, just wait here!<br><br>I'll go make a request to the top staff and return!<br><br>I'll definitely return with a good response!<br><br>No! What?!<br><br>Let go!<br><br>Why? Why me?<br><br>Be quiet! You'll disturb the baby in you.<br><br>We examined you while you were sleeping.<br><br>There's no mistake.<br><br>It's Shin's...<br><br>Onizuka, our only sample, is dead. Frankly, that left us at wit's end.<br><br>But now...<br><br>We have Shin and that mutant child.<br><br>Wonderful.<br><br>Precious samples.<br><br>We want you to take care of it.<br><br>If possible, we don't want to kill that child's father.<br><br>Where is he?<br><br>You decieved me!<br><br>You deceived me!<br><br>You deceived<br><br>But Onizuka is dead...<br><br>Who is this?<br><br>Who is calling me?<br><br>I have to go!<br><br>Someone is calling to me for help.<br><br>I have to go quickly!<br><br>What's wrong?<br><br>Are you okay?<br><br>Send someone, Chief!<br><br>Chief!<br><br>Get someone in here!<br><br>Have you made a decision, professor?<br><br>Let's talk about that later!<br><br>What is it? What's wrong?<br><br>You're the one who said we should treat this as important.<br><br>We have to take her to a doctor!<br><br>Open it.<br><br>Right.<br><br>Ai.<br><br>Ai!<br><br>Let's go.<br><br>Are you okay?<br><br>All of them...must be finished.<br><br>Chief.<br><br>Even if I surrender...<br><br>I'll just be held responsible and executed.<br><br>You guys...<br><br>...are going down with me!<br><br>Shin!<br><br>Ai!<br><br>Ai! Hold on!<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>Shin... I tricked you.<br><br>But...<br><br>I loved you.<br><br>I really loved you, Shin.<br><br>Ai...<br><br>Shin!<br><br>This child...<br><br>Please...

I didn't want to kill you.<br><br>You're the same as Onizuka.<br><br>No, now that I know you are a new cyborg soldier...<br><br>I cannot let you live.<br><br>For the sake of world peace.<br><br>Goodbye, Shin.<br><br>It doesn't matter how it looks when it's born.<br><br>It's the combination of Shin and I.<br><br>As long as this child is left...<br><br>I will be at peace.<br><br>Please, Shin.

plays,<br><br>it's not the pro ranks,<br>Lapchick.<br><br>It's the future...<br><br>- Oh...<br>-...Of the NBA.<br><br>Look, we already took a vote,<br>Ned.<br><br>Yeah well, the fans didn't vote<br>that way.<br><br>Let me ask you a question.<br><br>Who sells more tickets<br>than any other basketball team?<br><br>Go ahead, take a guess,<br>go ahead.<br><br>We all know it's the Trotters,<br>Irish.<br><br>That's right.<br>And since it's been decided<br><br>by the board of governors,<br><br>to not let the Trotters<br>have a franchise in this league,<br><br>I say,<br><br>we all draft great negro players<br>and put 'em on our teams.<br><br>How about one each, huh?<br><br>We each pick one player.<br><br>I mean, how hard is that?<br><br>It's what the fans want.<br><br>That's New York fans.<br><br>You don't know my fans.<br><br>What we're trying to get<br>through to you,<br><br>it's that times change.<br><br>You know,<br>it wasn't too long ago,<br><br>that a Jew wasn't permitted<br>to set foot on a hardwood,<br><br>never mind own a team.<br><br>Now, I have three Jewish<br>players on my roster.<br><br>So, what I'm trying to say<br>to you is, schmuck!<br><br>Don't be a schmuck!<br><br>Look, no matter how you feel<br>about this,<br><br>- it's good for business.<br>- Now, you're talking.<br><br>Irish, let's say that I<br><br>go along<br>with your letting negros<br><br>into the league program,<br>what does that make me?<br><br>Does that make me your friend?<br><br>You know what this is?<br><br>Huh?<br><br>You see that?<br><br>That, is my gate take<br>for the Knickerbocker season.<br><br>The whole season, $1,<br><br>That'll buy you a hot dog<br>and an orange drink.<br><br>on me.<br><br>Be my guest.<br><br>Irish, why are you fighting<br>so hard for this negro player?<br><br>Because he fought for us.<br><br>Sergeant Sweetwater Clifton<br><br>is a veteran<br>of the United States Army.<br><br>Sounds pretty distinguished<br>to me.<br><br>So uh,<br><br>shall we continue<br>with the draft?<br><br>Okay, uh, next up<br>is the Celtics' Walter Brown.<br><br>The Boston Celtics pick<br>Chuck Cooper from Duquesne.<br><br>We all know we allow<br>colored players into the draft,<br><br>but by gentlemen's agreement,<br>we don't actually select them.<br><br>He's eligible for the draft,<br>isn't he?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Well, then, I don't care<br>if he's striped,<br><br>plaid, polka dot,<br><br>the Boston Celtics<br>pick Chuck Cooper from Duquesne.<br><br>Okay, next up.<br><br>Washington Capitals.<br><br>Mr. McKinney.<br><br>The Washington Capital<br>select Earl Lloyd,<br><br>West Virginia State.<br><br>Okay, look,<br>I'm not telling you again,<br><br>you cannot draft negros!<br><br>Have you seen this guy play?<br><br>Have you seen any of these guys<br>play?<br><br>We have rules, Podoloff.<br><br>Maybe I want a negro<br>on my team, huh?<br><br>You're too late.<br><br>You should've made a motion<br>before.<br><br>-What

What is it?<br><br>Ms. Miller.<br><br>This is my fault.<br><br>Hey, hey, this is not your<br>fault, okay.<br><br>Look at me.<br><br>She wouldn't have even been<br>here if it wasn't for me.<br><br>Ms. Miller, you didn't do this<br>to her.<br><br>We're gonna get whoever did.<br><br>Do you think she was killed?<br><br>She could have fallen, it's<br>hard to say.<br><br>She texted her mom this morning.<br><br>We know, we're contacting her parents.<br><br>I spoke with Kayla's friend,<br>Sarah Swan like you asked.<br><br>Got some coffee in her.<br><br>She seemed sober but scared.<br><br>Do the names Zeke or Dean<br>mean anything to you?<br><br>Yeah, that's them.<br><br>Who are they?<br><br>We're looking into<br>it but first names only<br><br>is not much to go on.<br><br>Unless you have some more information.<br><br>They were buying a lot of drinks.<br><br>So that's basically all I remember.<br><br>It seems that Sarah was<br>told to keep Kayla close.<br><br>It's starting to look like<br>maybe your daughter was targeted<br><br>and maybe Becky just got in the way.<br><br>What?<br><br>Best thing that you can do<br>right now<br><br>is go somewhere safe<br>and be near your phone.<br><br>And if anything new comes<br>up, you call me, okay?<br><br>Right away.<br><br>You just fine my daughter, please.<br><br>I'll take you back.<br><br>Is that Kayla's phone?<br><br>Yeah, I'm just scrolling<br>through it<br><br>to see if I can find anything.<br><br>Any kind of clue, anything.<br><br>Something Detective Fisher<br>said got me thinking.<br><br>Who would target Kayla?<br><br>Do we know she was targeted?<br><br>Do we?<br><br>What's that supposed to mean?<br><br>Your trip, your plan.<br><br>Michelle.<br><br>And conveniently you lose<br>track of Kayla<br><br>right before she disappears<br><br>and you didn't even go check on her<br><br>after you guys had been drinking.<br><br>Isn't that what a best friend<br>would do?<br><br>It was late, I thought<br>that she was asleep.<br><br>So you just passed out?<br><br>Are you seriously blaming me<br>for this?<br><br>She left me probably 'cause<br>she was pissed at you.<br><br>Hey, this is no way to help Kayla<br><br>and why would she be helping<br>us if she was involved?<br><br>So let's all just take<br>a breath and figure out<br><br>our next steps.<br><br>We're supposed to stay put<br>but I don't trust these cops<br><br>to move fast enough.<br><br>We've already lost so much time.<br><br>You want us to find her<br>ourselves in this city?<br><br>We have to do something.<br><br>Oh my God.<br><br>An unknown number?<br><br>What do I do?<br><br>Answer it.<br><br>Hello?<br><br>Mom!<br><br>Kayla, baby?<br><br>Kayla where are you?<br><br>- Are you okay?<br>- Shut up.

She's alive.<br><br>Look, if she's still alive,<br><br>it means she can still come home.<br><br>What do we do, call the<br>cops, trace the number?<br><br>No, no cops.<br><br>You heard them.<br><br>Do you really think they can<br>be watching us that closely?<br><br>It's possible.<br><br>We can't just leave.<br><br>We're not leaving.<br><br>Should we call the detective?<br><br>Do you really want to risk that?<br><br>Doing nothing is not an option.<br><br>Kayla is alive but she's in trouble.<br><br>So I won't call the police.<br><br>What do you wanna do?<br><br>I'm gonna head out of town<br>first thing in the morning.<br><br>What?<br><br>If they're watching us that closely,<br><br>I want it to look like I'm<br>doing exactly what they asked.<br><br>But don't worry, I'm gonna<br>make a stop along the way.<br><br>Hey.<br><br>Hey, you're gonna be okay.<br><br>Okay, just calm down or you're<br>gonna get yourself hurt.<br><br>Look, if you promise not to scream<br><br>I won't put the gag back in.<br><br>You killed Becky.<br><br>It was an accident.<br><br>No one was supposed to get hurt.<br><br>You kidnapped me.<br><br>We were just supposed<br>to go out and have fun.<br><br>Does it look like I'm having<br>fun to you?<br><br>Please, just let me go.<br><br>Look, if you just hold on,<br><br>I promise you're gonna be okay.<br><br>I'm not gonna hurt you.<br><br>What about Dean?<br><br>Hey Zeke.<br><br>Can I talk to you for a minute?<br><br>Just out here.<br><br>What do you think this is man?<br><br>Play time?<br><br>You're not on a date with her anymore.<br><br>I know, but you don't have<br>to treat her like that, okay.<br><br>She's here, all right, we've got her.<br><br>So all we have to do is<br>wait and then let her go.<br><br>No, that was the plan, man.<br><br>That was the plan until you<br>decided to commit murder.<br><br>Okay, whoa, that was an<br>accident. You know that.<br><br>Oh, you think that's how<br>a jury is gonna see it?<br><br>You think that's how she sees<br>it?<br><br>Bro, don't you understand?<br><br>We can't ever let her go.<br><br>Not after what you've done.<br><br>All we gotta do is dump her, okay<br><br>and get out of here.<br><br>I mean, she's hurt,<br>she can't even compete.<br><br>What, and trust her<br>to keep her mouth shut?<br><br>Look, I can talk to her, I'll<br>explain.<br><br>She likes me.<br><br>Wait, you think she likes you?<br><br>Zeke, Zeke, you murdered her<br>best friend.<br><br>Zeke, look at me.<br><br>Let me be very clear here, dude.<br><br>She's not your friend.<br><br>Now I need you on my side, okay<br>Zeke?<br><br>Look, buddy, we're just<br>gonna stick to the plan<br><br>and be ready on schedule, okay?<br><br>What's going on?<br><br>She's going to the cops.<br><br>Come on.<br><br>Hey, hey.

She<br>barely even knows me.<br><br>Yeah, but this could be her warning.<br><br>Her warning?<br><br>Look, you knew that answer in chem<br><br>and her boyfriend helped<br>you get that track try out.<br><br>She wants you to back off.<br><br>Well, I definitely blew my<br>shot of getting on the team.<br><br>Look, we'll just say<br>it was allergies, okay?<br><br>But stay away from Tiffany.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Honey, how you feeling?<br><br>Was it a rough day?<br><br>I was at the tryout and<br>I was doing really well<br><br>and then I started itching.<br><br>Oh no.<br><br>And now I have a rash.<br><br>Oh, honey, that looks really painful.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>It was really embarrassing.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Honey.<br><br>- I'm sorry that happened.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Listen, I have an idea.<br><br>Why don't you invite one of your friends<br><br>from your old school this<br>weekend?<br><br>Really?<br><br>Yeah, really.

wait.<br><br>You, you could be onto something.<br><br>Yeah right,<br><br>like a cake could actually<br>make you lose weight.<br><br>I was developing something<br>like this on my own.<br><br>Remember when I interviewed at Montello<br><br>and then I didn't hear from<br>them for like six months<br><br>so I went to the Amazon?<br><br>I found this rare flower that<br>the locals said never to eat.<br><br>Is it poisonous?<br><br>No, they have a food shortage there.<br><br>Okay, and this relates to cake how?<br><br>They said eating it would<br>make you lose too much weight.<br><br>Did you tell them there's no such thing?<br><br>Okay, whatever.<br><br>And this rare flower?<br><br>I analyzed the cellular<br>structure of the stamen,<br><br>the haploid nucleus, the embryo sac.<br><br>How the diploid cell divides-<br><br>- Kinda losing me?<br><br>I found a unique compound<br>that triggers weight loss.<br><br>Now you got my attention.<br><br>I remember something<br>about the cacao bean<br><br>acting as an accelerant.<br><br>Sorry.<br><br>Blah!<br><br>Are my taste buds deceiving<br>me or is this one really good?<br><br>It's fantastic.<br><br>Wait, we did it?<br><br>We did it.<br><br>We did it!<br><br>That concludes today's sermon.<br><br>Everyone go in peace.<br><br>Yeah, it smells nice.<br><br>He does a good job.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>It's really good.<br><br>Nice

Mr.<br>Blackholly has had surgery<br><br>and won't be with us this evening.<br><br>This is Lucas Morello, and<br>I am Jacqueline Blackholly.<br><br>It's so nice to finally meet you.<br><br>- Nice to meet you.<br>- Hi.<br><br>Hi.<br><br>I'm really sorry to<br>hear about Mr. Blackholly.<br><br>Well, thank you.<br><br>He uh, would love to be here,<br>but he's in so much pain.<br><br>Wonderful.<br><br>I mean, not, not wonderful<br>that he's in pain.<br><br>Just, I, I didn't mean that.<br><br>I just, that you got to bring your friend.<br><br>Is it serious?<br><br>Mr. Blackholly's injury?<br><br>Well, it is painful and<br>a little embarrassing.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>He had an altercation with a nail gun<br><br>that one of our carpenters left behind.<br><br>Ouch.<br><br>Yes, he is on some pretty<br>stiff pain medication,<br><br>so I'm pretty sure he's fast asleep.<br><br>Oh, well, I I hope he<br>has a speedy recovery.<br><br>So do I.<br><br>Lucas is my personal assistant,<br><br>and I thought he could lend<br>a younger man's perspective<br><br>to your new invention.<br><br>Well, um,<br><br>why don't you to go have<br>a seat in the living room<br><br>and I'll bring out some appetizers.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>Oh, I, I can take this.<br><br>Here, it's just right through here?<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Go on.<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>What, what did I do now?<br><br>Lucas didn't sign the<br>non-disclosure agreement.<br><br>We don't know him from Adam.<br><br>Who's Adam?<br><br>Oh my gosh.<br><br>You are worrying too much.<br><br>We are covered.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>So, Jacqueline, I was, I was<br>kind of wondering about this-<br><br>- Oh!<br><br>Whoa, whoa!<br><br>Drinks?<br><br>Geez, dog.<br><br>I reviewed the proposal you<br>sent me and I was intrigued.<br><br>But after seeing the complete package,<br><br>I must say that this is very exciting.<br><br>Really?<br><br>Does your idea have a patent?<br><br>Of course.<br><br>Gluten-free cake that<br>makes you lose weight?<br><br>Ladies, you definitely<br>have a good idea here.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Now, how does it work?<br><br>Well, that's proprietary.<br><br>Ah, a secret ingredient.<br><br>Yes, the secret ingredient.<br><br>Yeah, but I must admit,<br>I'm a little skeptical.<br><br>I mean, gluten free?<br><br>Well, I can't wait to taste it.<br><br>Well, would you like some now?<br><br>I mean, I can bring it<br>out with some coffee.<br><br>Do you mind if we take a moment<br><br>before we sample your wonderful cake?<br><br>Of course.<br><br>Take your time.<br><br>I'd like to go out to the<br>garden for some fresh air.<br><br>This place even has a garden?<br><br>What'd you say the Chapman's do for money?<br><br>I didn't.<br><br>Hope, don't be such a clutz.<br><br>What did I do now?<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Isn't the fountain lovely, Lucas?<br><br>If this cake is real, what<br>do you think it's worth?<br><br>Possibly the greatest weight<br>loss creation in history.<br><br>Really?<br><br>So whoever owns this<br>will definitely be rich.<br><br>I would say so.<br><br>I assume you're planning<br>on buying this cash cow<br><br>right for Blackholly and Associates<br><br>for as little as possible.<br><br>I don't do business like that, Lucas.<br><br>No, no, no,<br><br>of course not.<br><br>I, I did, I didn't mean to imply, I just.<br><br>Oh, oh!<br><br>What the hell?<br><br>Oh my God!<br><br>What was that splashing noise?<br><br>Sound of our dreams<br>drowning in the fountain.<br><br>What?<br><br>Okay, you need to go get a robe<br><br>and a towel for Jacqueline.<br><br>Come on, come on.<br><br>All right.<br><br>Come on inside.<br><br>We'll get you a towel.<br><br>Lucas.<br><br>Oh, hey.<br><br>Delicious dinner.<br><br>I can't wait to taste that cake.<br><br>Uh-huh.<br><br>If anyone can make<br>gluten free taste good,<br><br>it's probably you.<br><br>So what are you looking for?<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Just, I'm really intrigued<br>by, by, by this cake.<br><br>You're gonna make a great<br>face for the company.<br><br>A face?<br><br>You know, you're a<br>real looker and smart.<br><br>Right.<br><br>So how long have you worked<br>for Blackholly and Associates?<br><br>Uh, well.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Oh!<br><br>Oh, did I do that?<br><br>No, no, no, no.<br><br>No need to fuss over me, Jacqueline.<br><br>No, no.<br><br>Listen, I'll just, I'll<br>run home and change, okay?<br><br>Save me a piece of that cake.<br><br>Excuse me.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Why don't you go relax on the<br>couch and I'll get the cake.<br><br>Oh, that sounds lovely.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>I'm so sorry.<br><br>Can I help?<br><br>No, no, no, no.<br><br>Absolutely not.<br><br>You're our guest.<br><br>Come on, let's go sit down.<br><br>Get you warmed up.<br><br>There you go.<br>Yeah.<br><br>Oh no, oh no!<br><br>Oh, oh my gosh!<br><br>Hun.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Oh my gosh.<br><br>Oh, I'll

Okay.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>Mortimer, I assume you're asleep by now.<br><br>Things got a bit crazy here,<br><br>and I'm gonna stay for a little while<br><br>and wait for Faith and Hope to come back.<br><br>Call me if you need me.<br><br>Bye.<br><br>Oh, it's okay, Coco, it's okay.<br><br>Oh my!<br><br>Sharon, our dog, he's-<br><br>- Eh, eh, eh, not Sharon, Sharon.<br><br>What?<br><br>Our, our, our dog, he ate chocolate.<br><br>We think he's dying.<br><br>Oh honey, is it breathing?<br><br>Yes, but he is making<br>this awful, awful noise.<br><br>Dr. Dogwood!<br><br>Oh, so his name is funny to you?<br><br>- No, no, no, no.<br>- No, no, no.<br><br>Perhaps another vet<br>might meet your standards.<br><br>No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<br><br>We're very sorry.<br><br>We just are very concerned about our dog.<br><br>We didn't mean any disrespect.<br><br>Dr. Dogwood will be here in a moment.<br><br>Please have a seat.<br><br>But Coco is really sick.<br><br>Where is the

yes.<br><br>Stool and urine samples.<br><br>A transdermal plasmectomy.<br><br>Are you just making this up?<br><br>He ate chocolate.<br><br>Can't you just pump his stomach?<br><br>My dear uneducated plebeian,<br><br>we are far beyond the<br>stomach pumping stage.<br><br>Please, just save Coco.<br><br>Hope, I've never seen you so assertive.<br><br>Oh, should I ask him to forgive me?<br><br>No, it was great.<br><br>Let's go sit down.<br><br>Hello?<br><br>Is anybody here?<br><br>Faith, Hope?<br><br>What happened here?<br><br>Hm.<br><br>It's actually good.<br><br>Faith,

drinking<br>because of the strength<br><br>and openness you show in<br>everything else, but no longer.<br><br>This flaw, which I have<br>learned is better described<br><br>as a disorder, has been with<br>you for most of your life.<br><br>13, Doug, you were a child<br>when you had your first drink.<br><br>There is not a<br>time, day or night,<br><br>when you don't have<br>the flask on you.<br><br>It's always been<br>escalating slowly<br><br>and I have mistaken that<br>as being in control of it.<br><br>Your drinking is to the<br>detriment of your health<br><br>and our relationship.<br><br>Accidents I have<br>had to deal with,<br><br>stumbling doing your hard work,<br><br>falling off the couch<br>and cutting your head.<br><br>Drunkenly punching your<br>hand against the wall.<br><br>You've always been a homebody,<br>but you and that flask<br><br>have all but completely<br>retreated into your study.<br><br>We all love you.<br><br>You need help, Doug.<br><br>Accept this opportunity please.<br><br>- Keith.<br><br>(paper rustling)<br><br>- Doug, I've always admired you.<br><br>Your ability to build things<br>and see things to the end.<br><br>This house, your business,<br>this gorgeous family.<br><br>Doug, God has blessed<br>you with determination<br><br>and you've done so<br>much with that gift.<br><br>Doug, I have such<br>respect for you.<br><br>The Lord's blessings<br>also come with challenges<br><br>that He asked us to overcome.<br><br>Doug, we both struggle<br>with being stubborn men.<br><br>We think our way<br>is the right way,<br><br>but there's nothing right<br>with having six drinks<br><br>when we go out together.<br><br>Doug, I'm asking you as a<br>friend to keep an open mind<br><br>and to listen to<br>what your family<br><br>and what God has to say to you.<br><br>I know you'll make<br>the right decision.<br><br>- There's so much<br>love in this room.<br><br>Chloe, dear, your turn.<br><br>- Well, mine's short.<br><br>(paper rustling)<br><br>Dad, I don't know what's<br>normal or what's right,<br><br>which are pretty subjective.<br><br>When I see you crashing on<br>the couch, flask nearby,<br><br>I see the hardest<br>working person I know<br><br>relaxing in his own way.<br><br>We grow up being asked to<br>better ourselves every day.<br><br>You're a far better<br>person than I am, dad,<br><br>but do you think the happiest<br>and healthiest version of you<br><br>drinks the way you do now?<br><br>It's up to you.<br><br>- You're the rock<br>of this family,<br><br>your friends, and your business.<br><br>You overcome what<br>life throws at you<br><br>while bearing the troubles<br>of those who need you.<br><br>You are the definition<br>of supportive<br><br>in the way that you bring<br>your intelligence, passion,<br><br>and humor to others.<br><br>You supported cooking stoves<br>when no one else would.<br><br>Chloe and I had an<br>amazing childhood<br>because of you and mom.<br><br>You've always been there for us,<br><br>please let us be there for you.<br><br>When we talk on the phone,<br><br>you try to hide the fact that<br>you're slurring your words.<br><br>You drink as a coping mechanism<br><br>and it's hurting you and<br>everyone close to you.<br><br>We've all done learning and<br>growing in preparing for this.<br><br>And by participating,<br><br>you've shown your willingness<br>to grow and learn with us.<br><br>(somber music)<br><br>There's this great<br>facility in Florida,<br><br>it's called Coast Path Healing.<br><br>- Florida?<br><br>- The best for senior<br>treatment is Coast Way.<br><br>But I can email a fair list of<br>great California facilities.<br><br>- So what do you say?<br><br>- Look, I appreciate<br>all your concerns<br><br>and I know this embarrassing<br>ordeal came from a good place,<br><br>but there's no way in hell<br>I'm going to some facility.<br><br>If my drinking really makes<br>all of you that uncomfortable,<br><br>I'll be more conscientious<br>just going forward.<br><br>I'll give you my word,<br><br>that's the compromise<br>I'm willing to make.<br><br>- You are a highly<br>functioning sufferer of AUD.<br><br>You need professional help.<br><br>- Professionals who know<br>all the abbreviations.<br><br>- Acronym.<br>- AUD is an initialism.<br><br>- Who cares?<br><br>- Doug, please<br>don't be combative.<br><br>- I'm trying to meet<br>you halfway here.<br><br>- Dad, you have a problem.<br><br>- We all have problems, why do<br>you get to come into my house<br><br>and tell me mine?<br><br>- Doug, everyone<br>is here for you,<br><br>you need to do right by them.<br><br>If you refuse treatment,<br>there will be consequences.<br><br>Each person has prepared one.<br><br>- Oh, your last resort<br>is to strong arm me?<br><br>This I wanna hear.<br><br>- No one's strong arming.<br><br>- What's your consequence?<br><br>- Dad.<br>- Go on.<br><br>- If you don't get help,<br>I'll stop visiting the house.<br><br>- Wow, four times<br>a year to zero.<br><br>Big deal.<br><br>Keith, your consequence.<br><br>- Take some time to<br>think about it, Doug.<br><br>And I'm sorry it's come to this.<br><br>I know it's difficult for you.<br><br>But until you make<br>the right choice,<br><br>I can't take part in the<br>erosion of your life anymore.<br><br>- The erosion of my life.<br><br>At least I make an<br>honest living, you snake.<br><br>- Why do you have to<br>make this so hard?<br><br>- What's yours?<br><br>- Doug, listen-<br>- Oh, I'm listening.<br><br>- Please.<br>- Consequence now!<br><br>- I'll file for a divorce.<br><br>- Get the papers.<br><br>I'll sign.<br><br>You damn coward, Fay.<br><br>- Enough!<br><br>God, we get it,<br>Dad, you're pissed.<br><br>- Get the fuck out! All of you.<br><br>This is my home<br>too. Everyone stays.<br><br>- Chloe, what was<br>your consequence?<br><br>- I didn't have one,<br>Dad, it's your life.<br><br>- Damn right.<br><br>(gentle dramatic music)<br><br>(crickets chirping)<br><br>(gentle dramatic<br>music continues)<br><br>- Empty your pockets.<br><br>(phone clattering)<br><br>(Doug grunting)<br><br>Back to the house real slow.<br><br>- My truck and my<br>cash are yours.<br><br>I won't say a word and<br>you will never hear-<br><br>- I wish that was enough.<br><br>The more difficult you<br>make things for me,<br><br>the more I make 'em for you.<br><br>- I got a family.<br><br>- We all do.<br><br>- They're inside,<br>please don't hurt them.<br><br>- We'll come to that.<br><br>Move.<br><br>- Unbelievably<br>selfish of you, Chloe.<br><br>- I didn't wanna do this.<br><br>- Stop it you two.<br><br>- She just had to<br>undermine all of us.<br><br>- You always need<br>someone else to blame.<br><br>- Ladies, enough.<br><br>- Emotions are running high.<br><br>Breathe with me.<br><br>(inhaling and exhaling)<br><br>Doug left on his<br>own.

But I need<br>all hands on deck today,<br><br>all three of us.<br><br>She'll be here in an hour.<br><br>An hour?<br><br>- Yep. Head office.<br>- Head office...<br><br>It's the first time<br>they've sent someone.<br><br>We've never sailed this close<br>to the wind before.<br><br>We're in trouble.<br><br>Now, I need you<br>to impress this woman<br><br>if we've got any chance<br>of repairing the sanctuary<br><br>or even surviving the year.<br><br>Why don't you read<br>one of your papers to her?<br><br>- Kyle...<br>- What?<br><br>Firstly, she won't want to<br>hear me waffle on<br><br>about the behavioral patterns of<br>little blue penguins.<br><br>And secondly,<br>can we even trust head office?<br><br>You don't trust anyone.<br><br>I trust you, Parker,<br>and the penguins. That's it.<br><br>The Institute has kept this<br>place going for nearly 20 years.<br><br>They're not gonna shut us down.<br><br>Now, I know this<br>isn't your thing,<br><br>but I'm asking for your help.<br><br>Yeah, OK. Whatever.<br><br>Good! And you can start<br>by getting a pavlova...<br><br>From Fiona's.

You got this.<br><br>Gemma, I've never worked<br>in a sanctuary before.<br><br>I mean, I volunteered<br>with squirrels,<br><br>but they're pretty independent.<br><br>- I don't think it counts.<br>- Bah, bah, bah, Tilly, Tilly.<br><br>You have a degree in biology.<br><br>You spent the last 5 years<br>working in the Institute.<br><br>And now, you're finally here,<br>in this place that really...<br><br>that really needs your help.<br><br>You were born for this.<br><br>Writing compliance reports<br>for discovery centers<br><br>isn't the same thing, Gemma.<br><br>- It's not!<br>- Imagine it's 1997.<br><br>Be your 14-years-old self,<br><br>you know, dreaming of<br>working with animals.<br><br>OK, I know.<br><br>- What?<br>- I know.<br><br>- What?<br>- Let's do the thing.<br><br>- What thing?<br>- The thing.<br><br>The thing we always did whenever<br>we started at a new school.<br><br>I barely remember the thing.<br><br>Ah!<br><br>Ah!

This is Gemma.<br><br>Hi! Nice to meet you.<br>Nice to meet you.<br><br>- Nice to meet you.<br>- I'm her assistant.<br><br>She's my sister.<br><br>She decided to join me<br>on a last-minute break.<br><br>She doesn't get out<br>very much, so...<br><br>- No. Not at all.<br>- No.<br><br>I just want to say,<br>I am so glad to be here.<br><br>Oh! And before I forget, a gift.<br><br>We heard that Fiona's pavlovas<br>was something special,<br><br>so I just had to bring one.<br><br>I thought we could,<br>you know, celebrate.<br><br>Celebrate what?<br><br>All the exciting<br>times ahead, right?<br><br>Oh, and before I forget,<br><br>I wanted to organize a VIP tour<br><br>for someone who<br>helped me earlier today.<br><br>Oh, what a thoughtful gesture.<br>And who's the lucky local?<br><br>His name is, um,<br>oh, Fletcher Grant.<br><br>Ah! This place is so... quaint.<br><br>Who's that?<br><br>Oh, um, that's my grandfather.<br><br>Ah.<br><br>One of the sanctuary's founders.<br><br>A family business, I like that.<br><br>A member of the Price family<br>has overseen the sanctuary<br><br>since it was founded.<br><br>Well, why don't we<br>keep it that way?<br><br>The head zoologist<br>is just about to start a tour.<br><br>You're welcome to join us.<br><br>Oh, little blue penguins<br>are very special creatures.<br><br>Well, only if I'm not<br>gonna be in the way.<br><br>I'm in the way all the time.<br>They're used to it.<br><br>And I can take you to the inn<br>after the tour.<br><br>Which begins this way.<br><br>Wow!<br><br>Yeah. And this is<br>our learning center.<br><br>Oh my God, the kids<br>would love this!<br><br>Amazing! Look at these<br>little blue penguins right here.<br><br>Ah! Fletcher, there you are.<br><br>Tilly Monterey,<br>please meet Dr. Fletcher Grant.<br><br>- Hi!<br>- Hi.<br><br>Perhaps you meant that<br>Fletcher owed you a VIP tour.<br><br>Fletcher is our head zoologist.<br><br>And, uh, you two will be<br>working closely together.<br><br>Tilly here got us a pavlova.<br><br>From Fiona's.<br><br>Kyle, you're not gonna<br>believe this, but Fletcher...<br><br>OK, can you not<br>right now, please?<br><br>Should have gotten<br>to Fiona's bakery earlier<br><br>and loves giving VIP tours.<br><br>Welcome to the<br>Crystal Bay Penguin Sanctuary.<br><br>Welcome to our little home.<br><br>The pleasure is all mine.<br><br>I would love to<br>meet the residents.<br><br>Sure thing. Right this way.<br><br>- After you.<br>- I got it.<br><br>Here they are!<br><br>Oh, you're so adorable!<br><br>You're so cute!<br>Yes, you are!<br><br>So, little blue penguins<br><br>are the smallest breed<br>of penguin in the world<br><br>with a height of<br>around 30 centimeters<br><br>and weighing just 1.71 kilos.<br><br>So they stick together<br>when they're hunting<br><br>or making their way<br>back to their burrows.<br><br>I thought birds made nests.<br><br>Uh, they do.<br><br>The burrows are<br>small enclosed tunnels.<br><br>They make nests<br>inside the burrow.<br><br>Oh! A good master bedroom<br>is so important.<br><br>Introduce me.<br><br>I'm sorry?<br><br>Introduce me.<br>What are their names?<br><br>Ah. Well, this is Bailey.<br><br>He's 4 years old and has<br>a terrible sense of direction.<br><br>Oh, I understand, Bailey.<br><br>I have been<br>in San Diego for years,<br><br>and I still get lost<br>on my way home.<br><br>And this is Victor.<br><br>He's our lone ranger.<br><br>And he just cannot seem<br>to find a mate!<br><br>Me too, Victor,<br>so, um, I can relate.<br><br>And who's that?<br><br>That's, um, that's Jules.<br><br>- Jules is Fletcher's favorite.<br>- I don't have favorites, Kyle.<br><br>Ha! All parents say that,<br>but they so do.<br><br>- Who's your favorite?<br>- Pickles.<br><br>You have 3 kids,<br>and the dog is your favorite?<br><br>Yeah. I stand by my choice!<br><br>And what is Jules' story?<br><br>Well, Jules was quite small<br>when we found her.<br><br>She had just begun<br>her first molt.<br><br>They can't swim when molting,<br>so they're vulnerable.<br><br>Do they return to the wild?<br><br>Most will, but some like Jules<br>here are long-term residents.<br><br>We provide the sanctuary,<br>somewhere they can be safe,<br><br>but they're a highly<br>community minded species.<br><br>So this isn't just a colony,<br>this is a...<br><br>Family.<br><br>Yeah, that's right. A family.<br><br>I think I've seen everything<br>I need to see here.<br><br>They're so cute.<br><br>- Here you go, buddy.<br>- Thanks, man.<br><br>- Here, honey.<br>- Thank you, darling.<br><br>Listen, I know the signs<br>are a little faded,<br><br>and no doubt you've noticed the<br>cracks along the pool edging,<br><br>but I believe, we believe...<br><br>You have a lovely facility here.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Look, let me start by saying<br>that I know you're all nervous,<br><br>but I'm really good<br>at identifying the issues<br><br>that hold a sanctuary back<br><br>and leveraging opportunities<br><br>to bring wonderful places<br>like this back to life.<br><br>OK, so...<br>What does that mean exactly?<br><br>I'm glad you asked,<br>because I have a plan.<br><br>Tilly always has a plan.<br><br>She packed pajamas for me.<br>Didn't even know I was coming.<br><br>Listen, you have a lovely<br>local community here, you do.<br><br>And you have an amazing facility<br>with adorable penguins.<br><br>We just need to bring<br>those two things together.<br><br>And if we do, I think<br>we can convince head office<br><br>to keep this place open.<br><br>- I do.<br>- Hang on.<br><br>What do you mean,<br>convince head office?<br><br>They want to shut us down?<br><br>They don't want to close this<br>place any more than you do, OK?<br><br>But most sanctuaries<br>are financially supported<br><br>with local funding<br>as well as the Institute.<br><br>Your community funding<br>is sitting at, what, 20%?<br><br>At this rate,<br>the Institute can't afford<br><br>to keep this place open<br>for much longer.<br><br>- They just can't.<br>- It's true.<br><br>We also used to receive<br>a government stipend,<br><br>but the mayor reduced it.<br><br>We're barely scraping by.<br><br>So, what happens if you<br>can't help us find our feet?<br><br>They'll close the center,<br><br>and they'll relocate<br>the penguins to...<br><br>- New Zealand.<br>- Yes.<br><br>There's a new facility there.<br><br>- Yeah, but it's not their home.<br>- No, it's not.<br><br>And home is everything.<br><br>Look, you have just<br>fallen off the map,<br><br>but I can help you<br>get back on it.<br><br>And I know that a week<br>isn't a lot of time, but...<br><br>- A week?<br>- Hey, hang on.<br><br>You're telling me we have<br>one week to fix this place,<br><br>or head office<br>will shut us down?<br><br>- But that isn't enough time.<br>- It could be.<br><br>I've seen sanctuaries thrive<br>with community support.<br><br>The locals don't care<br>about the penguins.<br><br>They care about their<br>ocean views and the town gossip.<br><br>They used to care.<br><br>Then we will remind them<br>how to care.<br><br>What do you say?<br><br>Give me a chance.<br><br>I'm in.<br><br>Me too.<br><br>Now, I know nothing<br>about penguins,<br><br>but I have two hands,<br>and they're all yours.<br><br>What do you say, Fletcher?<br><br>Come on!<br><br>Fine.<br><br>OK, should we do a, ""Whoo!""<br>or something like that?<br><br>Oh, oh, what sound<br>do penguins make?<br><br>- Oh yeah!<br>- Oh, it's not like...<br><br>- It's not?<br>- ""For the penguins.""<br><br>- Hmm?<br>- ""For the penguins.""<br><br>OK. One, two, three...<br><br>For the penguins!<br><br>Welcome to the Sea Spray Inn!<br><br>- Oh, wow!<br>- Yes.<br><br>This is like the place<br>I go to in my head<br><br>when I'm hiding out in the car...<br><br>When I'm meditating in the car.<br><br>- There's a pool.<br>- There is.<br><br>Oh!<br><br>- This is incredible, thank you.<br>- You're welcome.<br><br>- Tilly, there's a hot tub!<br>- OK.<br><br>She's just tired.<br>She's tired.<br><br>So what's this?<br><br>Uh, mostly just<br>some old records, really,<br><br>and some keepsakes<br>from the sanctuary's heyday.<br><br>We thought maybe you could<br>find some inspiration here.<br><br>Well, this is so helpful,<br>thank you.<br><br>Oh, it's the<br>very least I can do.<br><br>Kyle and I are<br>really glad you're here.<br><br>Well, that makes two of you.<br><br>Yes, well, Fletcher finds it<br>hard to trust new people,<br><br>but he'll come around.<br><br>OK.<br><br>Ah, guys.<br><br>Do you hear that?<br><br>Hear what?<br><br>Silence.<br><br>There's no kids,<br>there's no dogs,<br><br>just silence.<br><br>Ah!<br><br>- Can you breathe under there?<br>- Shhh! I'm in my happy place.<br><br>Oh, I love these pillows.<br><br>Ah, me too.<br><br>Kyle doesn't like pillows<br>at all,<br><br>which I cannot understand.<br><br>Who doesn't want to dive<br>into a sea of pillows?<br><br>Oh! Exactly. You are either<br>a pillow person or you're not.<br><br>- Mm-hmm.<br>- Period.<br><br>My husband, Bruce,<br><br>his whole bedtime routine is<br>brush his teeth, have a shower<br><br>and de-pillow the bed.<br><br>Kyle is exactly the same!<br><br>Just tosses them on the floor,<br><br>as if they're not more<br>expensive than his phone.<br><br>Which they must never know.<br><br>Oh, they must never know.<br><br>All right, well, look,<br>I'll let you two get settled in.<br><br>Thank you, Parker.<br><br>Oh, and by the way,<br><br>I'm playing down<br>at the Compass tonight.<br><br>It's nothing fancy,<br>but you should come along.<br><br>- We would love to.<br>- Awesome. I'll see you there!<br><br>Bye!<br><br>I am so well rested.<br><br>There is something<br>about Crystal Bay<br><br>that really agrees with me.<br><br>Yes, I can tell.<br>You slept for hours.<br><br>Yes!<br><br>I hope Fletcher's there.<br><br>I really want a second chance<br>at a first impression.<br><br>You know, he's not<br>a bad-looking man.<br><br>I hadn't noticed.<br><br>He has this charming kind of<br>outdoorsy thing going on.<br><br>And that was a nice smile<br>he gave you at the bakery.<br><br>That's before he knew who I was.<br><br>Yeah, I'm just saying.<br>What is that you're hiding?<br><br>You will... you will see.<br>You'll see.<br><br>If we don't want the penguins<br>to go to New Zealand,<br><br>she's our only option.<br><br>I did the hands in<br>the middle thing. I'm trying.<br><br>It's just that people<br>from head office,<br><br>they're from<br>a whole different world.<br><br>They're all about the<br>bottom line and ticking boxes.<br><br>Which I know is important,<br>but they just...<br><br>They don't know anything<br>about working in the field.<br><br>We could lose<br>everything, Fletcher.<br><br>We don't have<br>a lot of options left.<br><br>And besides, I have<br>a suspicion that Tilly<br><br>is exactly what<br>this place needs.<br><br>- Ah! You made it.<br>- We sure did.<br><br>I thought you guys would be<br>holed up at the inn<br><br>sleeping off the jet lag.<br><br>And miss the opportunity<br>to see Parker play?<br><br>Absolutely not.<br><br>- What can we get you? It's on me.<br>- No, please.<br><br>You're our guests. Allow me.<br><br>Oh, great!<br>I'll keep you company.<br><br>Fantastic.<br><br>Can we start again?<br><br>Sure. We could give it a go.<br><br>OK. I'm gonna give it a go.<br><br>Look, I know how much<br>the sanctuary means to you,<br><br>and I... I promise you<br>I'm gonna do everything I can<br><br>to help save it.<br><br>I'm sure you think<br>you mean that.<br><br>What does that mean?<br><br>I'm sure you have good<br>intentions, but you're a...<br><br>Pencil pusher from head office?<br><br>Working with animals<br>is a whole different...<br><br>- Kettle of fish.<br>- Could you stop that?<br><br>Salmon had to say it.<br><br>Ah. Finished?<br><br>You don't trust me.<br><br>It's not personal.<br><br>Well, I look forward<br>to changing your mind.<br><br>And hot chocolate<br>with extra marshmallows.<br><br>- Here you are, sir.<br>- Thanks.<br><br>- You're the best!<br>- I know.<br><br>OK, so I know<br>that we're off the clock,<br><br>but I have done<br>a little bit of research.<br><br>The Crystal Bay<br>Penguin Sanctuary<br><br>actually had its heyday<br>in the 1950s<br><br>after a wild colony<br>was discovered.<br><br>Exactly,<br>when little blue penguins<br><br>were found on the mainland.<br><br>And the birds needing help<br><br>were taken in by<br>a local ornithologist,<br><br>Kyle's grandfather.<br><br>He started the sanctuary with<br>a group of local scientists.<br><br>It's a pretty well-known story.<br><br>Right. The penguins became<br>international news.<br><br>People came from all over<br>the world to research them,<br><br>articles were written<br>about them,<br><br>and the town even<br>created a penguin day<br><br>to raise money<br>for the sanctuary.<br><br>That's my grandfather.<br>He'd do anything for a laugh.<br><br>The kids loved him.<br><br>Did you know that for 20 years,<br><br>80% of the sanctuary's budget<br>came from the community?<br><br>Really? How did you<br>find out about that?<br><br>I'm good at numbers<br><br>and digging through<br>50-year-old papers.<br><br>It's true.<br><br>- How did they get the funding?<br>- Simple. Community outreach.<br><br>OK, but that was in the 1950s<br><br>when penguins made<br>international headlines.<br><br>We're a sanctuary,<br>not a theme park.<br><br>We can't just<br>put on a show for them.<br><br>We don't have to.<br><br>What's this?<br><br>An invitation to the first<br>annual Penguin Sanctuary Gala,<br><br>and we're going to re-launch it<br>this Friday night.<br><br>This is how we<br>save the sanctuary, guys.<br><br>We're gonna invite everyone<br><br>from the mayor<br>to the scientific community.<br><br>We have to<br>bring people together.<br><br>We just have to remind everyone<br>that we're still here!<br><br>That's a great idea!<br><br>But how are we gonna manage<br>to pull this off?<br><br>We start tomorrow.<br><br>Then we better enjoy tonight.<br>It's going to be a busy week.<br><br>- Yes.<br>- Cheers!<br><br>Good evening, ladies and gents.<br><br>I'm Parker Price. Sit back,<br>relax and enjoy the music.<br><br>♪ We've been on our way<br><br>♪ We arrive today<br><br>♪ In the blink of an eye...<br><br>- He's great!<br>- He is. I'm a very lucky man.<br><br>Aw.<br><br>♪ And we never<br>have to run away... ♪<br><br>The sanctuary<br>requires urgent repairs.<br><br>How are you going to find<br>the money to fund this gala?<br><br>I think you mean ""we"".<br><br>♪ In a blink of an eye,<br>we built ourselves a home ♪<br><br>♪ Now we never<br>have to be alone ♪<br><br>Good morning, everyone!<br><br>So first thing's first:<br><br>I'm gonna do an audit<br>of all the repairs we need.<br><br>- Parker, you're with me.<br>- Yes, ma'am.<br><br>We'll be having<br>daily team meetings<br><br>starting at 12:00 p.m. sharp.<br><br>Don't be late.<br><br>What just happened?<br><br>Come on. Come on!<br><br>OK! So I think I got<br>most of the pilchards out.<br><br>And you were right,<br>the thermostat needs replacing.<br><br>It was frozen over.<br>Here you go.<br><br>You got the fish out?<br><br>Yes. I used an ice pick.<br>I almost got frostbite.<br><br>But I think there's enough<br>fish in there for a nice dinner.<br><br>What do you say, Bailey?<br><br>You have made their day.<br><br>I mean, they love sardines,<br><br>but these guys<br>are their favorite.<br><br>Pilchards are all the way<br>from Western Australia.<br><br>You want to try feeding them?<br><br>- Sure!<br>- There you go.<br><br>- OK.<br>- Oh.<br><br>Wait. How do I do it?<br><br>- Like this.<br>- OK, head first.<br><br>And then put your hand down.<br>Now we bend down.<br><br>And...<br><br>OK, guys!<br><br>Oh, here we go!<br>We have a taker!<br><br>- Now...<br>- Oh!<br><br>If you throw one in the water,<br>Cherry will dive for it.<br><br>OK. Ready?<br><br>She prefers to hunt<br>for her food.<br><br>There you go, Cherry!<br><br>Good job!<br><br>You really know<br>these little guys well.<br><br>Yeah. Yeah, they got<br>a lot of personality.<br><br>It's, um...<br><br>It's gonna be hard<br>to say goodbye.<br><br>You don't have<br>much faith, do you?<br><br>I want to, believe me, I do,<br><br>but I just don't see us<br>raising the money in time.<br><br>The people here will<br>come through. I can feel it.<br><br>Guys!<br><br>Guys! Oh, there you go!<br><br>You really care<br>about this place, don't you?<br><br>I do.<br><br>You're, um...<br>You're sparkling.<br><br>I'm just a little idealistic.<br><br>No, you're...<br>You are actually sparkling.<br><br>- Fish scale.<br>- Occupational hazard, I guess.<br><br>You should see me<br>at the end of the day.<br><br>I look like a disco ball.<br><br>- Oh, you do.<br>- Yep.<br><br>OK, who wants another one?<br>Here we go.<br><br>Who's hungry?<br><br>There you go, cutie.<br>Oh my gosh!<br><br>Five days left.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Tilly! My favorite<br>compliance manager.<br><br>How's it going down under?<br><br>Good. Everything<br>is under control.<br><br>Yeah? So you think you're<br>gonna turn things around?<br><br>Oh, yes, yes.<br><br>The issues are mainly<br>superficial, nothing major.<br><br>Um, we're gonna do<br>a few fundraising events<br><br>to up the sanctuary's profile<br><br>and a grand gala<br>on Friday night.<br><br>You're gonna do all that<br>in 5 days?<br><br>Yes. And I got to<br>feed the penguins.<br><br>It was amazing.<br><br>That's really impressive.<br><br>I mean, maybe I was<br>wrong about you.<br><br>You seem to be<br>thriving in the field.<br><br>Maybe you are ready<br>for a new position.<br><br>You know what?<br>I'm gonna come to this gala.<br><br>- So-sorry?<br>- Yeah, yeah.<br><br>I'm gonna come down,<br><br>show my support<br>for what you've done.<br><br>You know what the last time<br>I was in Australia was?<br><br>Bluesfest '99.<br><br>Yeah, that was it.<br>That was the festival.<br><br>Hey, you know what, Tilly?<br><br>There are new sanctuaries<br>opening up all the time.<br><br>And they're all in need of<br>qualified, enthusiastic staff.<br><br>Do you mean that, Mac?<br><br>Yeah.

It's no problemo.<br><br>I'm gonna...<br>I'm gonna die.<br><br>I knew it.<br><br>What?<br><br>That you also<br>love expensive pillows.<br><br>Shhh! They must never know!<br><br>No, that you're an artist!<br><br>I can tell a fellow creative<br>when I see one.<br><br>Gemma, this is beautiful.<br><br>Oh, thank you.<br>Well, I am an artist.<br><br>Well, I was an artist<br>in another life.<br><br>Before my beautiful children<br><br>and a dog we named after<br>a hot dog condiment.<br><br>- Hmm?<br>- Pickles.<br><br>- Cute.<br>- Here.<br><br>- It's my family.<br>- Aw. Gorgeous tribe.<br><br>I miss them.<br><br>But you keep them<br>close to your heart.<br><br>Yeah. I do.<br><br>But I've gotta say, it's really<br>nice to be painting again.<br><br>- Yeah.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>You know, you played<br>really beautifully last night.<br><br>- You did.<br>- Oh, thanks.<br><br>It's just a bit of fun.<br><br>No, no, you were really good.<br><br>Seriously.<br><br>Well, I made an album<br>back in the day.<br><br>On vinyl, no less.<br><br>Vinyl? On Vinyl.<br>How old are you?<br><br>- I was trying to be edgy.<br>- Ah!<br><br>It didn't even have a cover.<br><br>Hmm.<br><br>I think it's important to have<br>a creative outlet.<br><br>It's so easy<br>to lose your identity<br><br>when there's so many people<br>that need you.<br><br>It's so true.<br><br>I just wish that Bruce and I<br>had more time together, just us.<br><br>We couldn't afford a honeymoon<br>when we were married.<br><br>We've been meaning<br>to have one since, but...<br><br>Time slips away.<br><br>Yeah. Yeah, it does.<br><br>Have you talked to him about it?<br><br>No.<br><br>Well, relationships go through<br>all different chapters.<br><br>Maybe you're due<br>for a romantic one.<br><br>Parker.<br><br>- What was it called?<br>- Hmm?<br><br>Your album.<br><br>Deep Blue Dreams.<br><br>Nice.<br><br>Deep Blue Dreams. Hmm.<br><br>Deep Blue Dreams.<br><br>OK, people, listen up.<br><br>Right here, we have<br>a strategic plan of attack!<br><br>I mean, success, right?<br><br>Step one: bake sale.<br><br>I know it's old fashioned,<br><br>but a good cookie will<br>endear us to the community,<br><br>and I make a mean ginger snap.<br><br>Step two:<br>bring back penguin day.<br><br>I'm thinking a<br>behind-the-scenes type thing.<br><br>Kyle, Parker, that's you.<br><br>Step three: talk to the mayor.<br><br>We are bringing our local<br>funding back, OK?<br><br>Can you come up with<br>a presentation, Fletcher?<br><br>You be the brains,<br>I can be the...<br><br>Beauty.<br><br>What?<br><br>I was thinking brawn, but...<br><br>That's the same. Brains and...<br><br>OK. Yeah, I hear it.<br>Carry on. Sure, yep.<br><br>OK. Step four: the grand gala<br>on Friday night.<br><br>- Got it.<br>- Fletcher!<br><br>We'll make the guest list.<br><br>We need the scientific community<br>to know that we're here.<br><br>- OK! So what can I do?<br>- You. Um...<br><br>You painted a perfect sign,<br>so I'm thinking...<br><br>We still need banners.<br><br>We still need posters<br>for all the events,<br><br>including the gala and invites!<br><br>I'm thinking old school.<br><br>I'm thinking fancy.<br>Oh, and a theme.<br><br>Well, it's a re-launch,<br>so why don't we go vintage?<br><br>Like, uh,<br>honor the original gala.<br><br>- 1950s glamour!<br>- Yes!<br><br>OK! So, we have our<br>marching orders, people.<br><br>We have a week to get moving.<br>Let's go!<br><br>- Yes!<br>- For the penguins!<br><br>Nope.<br><br>- But I thought we were all...<br>- Nope!<br><br>Never mind.<br><br>No problemo.<br><br>So, should we call them<br>""penguin ginger bread men,""<br><br>""ginger penguins""<br>or ""ginger bread penguins""?<br><br>Uh... That one,<br>""ginger bread penguins.""<br><br>I think ""ginger penguins""<br>has a ring to it.<br><br>OK.<br><br>Hey! Stop sampling<br>the merchandise!<br><br>How am I supposed to sell<br>something I haven't even tried?<br><br>Fine, I'm calling them<br>""ginger penguins.""<br><br>OK.<br><br>Looking good!<br><br>I have a great<br>feeling about today.<br><br>We've been out spreading the<br>word about penguin day tomorrow.<br><br>I love it when<br>a good plan comes together.<br><br>Me too.<br><br>Ah, ah, ah!<br>No sampling the merchandise.<br><br>That's my job.<br><br>Feels good getting out<br>into the community,<br><br>like my grandfather.<br><br>He used to dress up<br>in a penguin costume<br><br>just to get a laugh.<br><br>We've never done<br>anything like that before.<br><br>- Well, now's your chance.<br>- Yeah, sounds good.<br><br>Look, I'm sure the people<br>of Crystal Bay will step up.<br><br>That's what neighbors<br>are for, right?<br><br>Right.<br><br>Don't forget to join us<br>tomorrow here for penguin day!<br><br>This isn't good.<br>I thought it would be busier.<br><br>It will be.<br><br>We just have to wait<br>for the rush hour foot traffic.<br><br>If you say so.<br><br>Hey, can you hold the fort<br>for a minute?<br><br>I'm just gonna go get something.<br><br>I'll do my best.<br><br>Hey. I'll be right back.<br><br>OK.<br><br>- Tilly!<br>- Fiona!<br><br>You seem to be<br>settling right in.<br><br>I am!<br><br>Oh, and you can be the first<br>to try our ""ginger penguins.""<br><br>Oh! A good old-fashioned<br>bake sale, my favorite. Here.<br><br>- Thank you.<br>- Oh. Ooh!<br><br>That is for you.<br><br>Thank you!<br><br>Oh!<br><br>It's too much ginger?<br><br>It's unusual.<br><br>- It's good, though.<br>- OK.<br><br>I'm gonna save the rest<br>for later, hey? So...<br><br>What's all this in aid of?<br><br>Oh, the sanctuary<br>needs some repairs.<br><br>Oh, nothing too serious, I hope.<br><br>We may have to close our doors<br>if additional funding...<br><br>What Fletcher is trying to say<br><br>is we just want to be in the<br>larger community and spread joy,<br><br>just like you do<br>with your bakery.<br><br>- Mm-hmm.<br>- Oh, that's a lovely idea.<br><br>Here, let me buy<br>another cookie, hey?<br><br>Oh, Fi. Here we go.<br><br>Oh, that's not necessary.<br><br>Don't forget to<br>join us Friday, penguin day.<br><br>Ah!<br><br>How many have we sold?<br><br>Twelve.<br><br>So that's $12?<br><br>Or 24 anchovies.<br><br>Look, maybe we should just<br>call it a day.<br><br>We tried our best.<br><br>- Hi!<br>- Fiona! What is this?<br><br>I'm sorry, I cannot stand by<br><br>while you try to sell<br>those awful biscuits.<br><br>Here are some pavlovas,<br>and there's more on the way.<br><br>Guys, do you wanna go<br>and grab the rest?<br><br>Fiona, you didn't<br>have to do this.<br><br>It's my pleasure!<br>I had the oven on anyway.<br><br>Consider it a donation.<br>My accountant will.<br><br>Well, it's very thoughtful<br>of you, so thank you.<br><br>You're welcome. That's what<br>community's all about.<br><br>Let's have a look, eh?<br><br>Oh!<br><br>Is that pavlova<br>from Fiona's bakery?<br><br>Yes, it is.<br>It's a penguin pavlova.<br><br>Mm-hmm.<br><br>In honor of<br>tomorrow's penguin day,<br><br>right here at the sanctuary.<br><br>Well, I'll take one. How much?<br><br>- $10...<br>- Like, $10?<br><br>- $20.<br>- $20.<br><br>- $20.<br>- $20.<br><br>Sold.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>There you go.<br><br>- Well, thank you.<br>- You're so welcome.<br><br>- See you tomorrow.<br>- See you.<br><br>- Thank you so much.<br>- Here you go. Amazing!<br><br>Yep, one for you. Enjoy.<br><br>- Yep. OK, thank you.<br>- Whoa, here you go.<br><br>Also, we're doing our presales<br><br>of our fundraising gala<br>on Friday night.<br><br>Everyone?<br><br>Has anyone seen Parker?<br>We're gonna need more hands.<br><br>Thank you so much.<br><br>All right! Who wants to hear a<br>song about Paisley the penguin?<br><br>Just like Grandfather.<br><br>♪ Paisley the penguin<br>was small as can be ♪<br><br>♪ She lived in a wee house<br>sat by the sea ♪<br><br>♪ She asked her two friends<br>to come over for tea ♪<br><br>♪ And they dove in the ocean<br>and swam happily ♪<br><br>Now take it swimming!<br><br>That's it! Awesome job,<br>everybody! Hurray!<br><br>OK. There's a second verse.<br>Should we do that?<br><br>- Yeah.<br>- See you!<br><br>- Bye!<br>- Thanks for coming!<br><br>Bye-bye! Hi! See you later.<br><br>Hey, splendid afternoon, Tilly.<br><br>Oh, thanks.<br><br>I'm really looking forward<br>to the gala<br><br>and checking out<br>the penguin day tomorrow.<br><br>I haven't been inside this place<br>since I was a kid.<br><br>Amazing! We can't wait<br>to see you tomorrow.<br><br>- See you then.<br>- Thanks, Derek. Bye!<br><br>Derek? I thought<br>his name was Kevin.<br><br>No, his name is Derek,<br><br>and he is the president of<br>the small business association,<br><br>and he just bought 12 tickets<br>to the gala.<br><br>You're incredible.<br><br>Hey, boys.<br>Could you, uh, finish up here?<br><br>- You got it.<br>- No problem.<br><br>- Come for a walk?<br>- Uh, yeah.<br><br>Bye.<br><br>- Bye!<br>- Bye!<br><br>I always feel<br>so calm around water.<br><br>This place is so beautiful.<br>It's like...<br><br>It's rugged, you know,<br>but it still feels...<br><br>- Safe?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Yeah. The penguins<br>think so too.<br><br>You see that<br>cute little cottage?<br><br>I bet the people that live there<br>are deliriously happy,<br><br>and they have hot chocolate<br>every night before bed.<br><br>I bet it has a leaky faucet<br>that drips all night.<br><br>You're so cynical!<br><br>Hey, we can't all<br>turn a bake sale<br><br>into a impromptu street party.<br><br>You're a real natural<br>with people, you know that?<br><br>I just think people<br>are inherently good,<br><br>and they want to be part of<br>something bigger.<br><br>Forever the optimist.<br><br>So, tell me, what makes you you?<br><br>Growing up, my dad<br>was part of the military,<br><br>so we used to move around a lot.<br><br>Right.<br><br>And as a result, everything<br>felt temporary, you know?<br><br>Like, I never felt like<br>I belonged and...<br><br>I mean, I went to<br>6 different high schools.<br><br>Wow. Must have been<br>tough on you.<br><br>It made me good at<br>getting to know people quickly.<br><br>- I've moved... twice.<br>- Twice.<br><br>In my whole life, yeah.<br><br>That sounds like paradise.<br><br>I don't know. I just...<br><br>I crave this sense of...<br><br>feeling grounded<br>in one place, you know?<br><br>And I just... I love being<br>part of a community.<br><br>Community.<br><br>Yeah, I've<br>lived here for 6 years,<br><br>and I thought<br>Derek's name was Kevin.<br><br>- Oh.<br>- So I'm not so good with that.<br><br>Well, luckily, I'm good at<br>bringing people together.<br><br>Hey, you see<br>that island out there?<br><br>Right on the other side<br>is a wild penguin colony.<br><br>Hmm.<br><br>That island<br>is a natural sanctuary.<br><br>When our penguins are ready,<br>that's where we'll take them.<br><br>They'll spend the day<br>in the water fishing,<br><br>but at night,<br><br>they swim to shore as a group<br>to make their way home,<br><br>waiting if one of them<br>lags behind,<br><br>watching out for each other,<br>step by step.<br><br>Penguins are amazing.<br><br>The penguins, sure.<br>But the people? Meh.<br><br>They don't really know how to<br>stick together, not like that.<br><br>They just don't seem to know<br>how to care.<br><br>Well, maybe we need to<br>give them a reason to care.<br><br>Forever the optimist, huh?<br>Come on.<br><br>Hey, baby! How did you sleep?<br><br>Harper tried to eat my crayons.<br><br>Where are the penguins?<br><br>They're asleep right now.<br>They're in bed.<br><br>Do penguins have<br>a bath time too?<br><br>Yeah, they sure do.<br><br>And guess what they have<br>for dinner? Fish.<br><br>Can we have<br>fish fingers? Daddy?<br><br>Not for breakfast. All right,<br>time for school, girls.<br><br>Say, ""Bye, Mommy"".<br><br>- Bye, Mommy! Love you.<br>- Love you. Bye-bye.<br><br>Bye! Bye, baby! I love you.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Oh, Gemma!<br>These are beautiful.<br><br>You should get back to painting.<br><br>You know, I've been<br>thinking about that<br><br>ever since we got here.<br><br>When I'm not missing the kids.<br><br>How are they?<br><br>Well, Harper tried to<br>eat some crayons.<br><br>And Mason won<br>his first soccer game.<br><br>And Harriet came third<br>in the art fair.<br><br>- Mmm.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>They're my own little<br>flock of penguins.<br><br>Well, actually, when they're<br>a group of penguins,<br><br>they're called a colony.<br><br>But when they're swimming,<br>they're called a raft.<br><br>- Wow!<br>- Mmm.<br><br>Sounds to me like someone's<br>been spending quality time<br><br>with a certain zoologist.<br><br>Well, we did...<br><br>Yeah?<br><br>Go for a walk<br>down by the bay.<br><br>Oh, Tilly, that sounds romantic.<br><br>I remember when Bruce and I<br>started dating.<br><br>We used to go for these walks,<br><br>and we'd just talk about<br>everything and nothing.<br><br>We're not dating.<br>I go back in 4 days, Gemma.<br><br>I miss romance, Tilly. I do.<br><br>There's nothing<br>romantic about it.<br><br>Would it be so bad if there was?<br><br>All right!<br><br>One side's higher<br>than the other.<br><br>- You sure?<br>- I think so.<br><br>- Which side?<br>- The left.<br><br>All right.<br><br>No. I mean the right.<br><br>Really?<br><br>- Maybe it's the left.<br>- Ugh!<br><br>Kyle...<br><br>- Yeah?<br>- I love you.<br><br>Me too.<br><br>But please leave it alone.<br>It's perfect!<br><br>Good morning!<br><br>Oh, I got everyone's<br>favorite coffee orders.<br><br>Thank you!<br><br>Absolutely no more caffeine<br>for Kyle. No, sir.<br><br>- Thank you.<br>- OK! That's two for me.<br><br>Wow!<br><br>- What if it rains?<br>- It won't rain.<br><br>What if there are no donations<br>or nobody comes?<br><br>Kyle, everything's<br>gonna be fine.<br><br>You'll see.<br><br>- Hi!<br>- See?<br><br>I thought you might<br>need breakfast.<br><br>Thank you! Oh. Oh my God!<br><br>Good?<br><br>Oh, I wanted to ask you:<br><br>The pavlova,<br>what do you put in it?<br><br>OK, the freshest eggs...<br><br>- You've done it again.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>♪ ♪ Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa ♪<br><br>♪ When you're smiling<br><br>♪ Smiling<br><br>♪ You make<br>the whole world happy ♪<br><br>♪ When you're laughing<br><br>OK, yeah.

Start now!<br><br>- And what do I talk about?<br>- Oh, I don't know.<br><br>Things the public are<br>interested in. Cute facts.<br><br>Cute facts...<br>Cute facts, cute facts.<br><br>Like that their<br>droppings sparkle<br><br>because they're<br>full of fish scales,<br><br>and when the light hits it,<br>it sparkles.<br><br>It's kind of pretty, actually.<br><br>No, Fletcher,<br>not facts about droppings.<br><br>No?<br><br>Tell them about, well,<br>Bailey and Victor and Jules.<br><br>Talk about their<br>behavioral habits<br><br>and raising their chicks.<br><br>You know how I feel<br>about public speaking.<br><br>I know.<br><br>But if we want them<br>to care about us...<br><br>We have to give them<br>a reason to care.<br><br>Exactly.<br><br>- Wish me luck.<br>- Good luck. You got this!<br><br>Hello, everyone,<br><br>and welcome to the Crystal Bay<br>Penguin Sanctuary!<br><br>Where are you all<br>running off to?<br><br>Uh, little blue penguins<br>are a lot like you and me.<br><br>And just like at your house,<br><br>they like to<br>spread out the chores.<br><br>Like Bailey here,<br><br>who is currently making a new<br>nest for his partner, Lemondrop.<br><br>Lemondrop.<br><br>Which means that Lemondrop<br><br>is in charge of finding dinner.<br><br>Now show of hands, kids, who<br>likes anchovies on their pizzas?<br><br>Ew!<br><br>Ew?<br><br>OK!

Come again.<br><br>Thank you so much.<br>Had the photo taken.<br><br>- Brilliant.<br>- Bye for now.<br><br>So, as president of the<br>small business association,<br><br>I'm sure you appreciate<br>the importance<br><br>of community engagement.<br><br>Um, you work closely<br>with the mayor, right?<br><br>I do. I'd be more than happy<br>to put in a good word.<br><br>I'd like to talk about<br>reinstating our funding.<br><br>We've been left out in the cold,<br>and I'd like to fix that.<br><br>Understood. If you<br>can't rely on your neighbor,<br><br>who can you rely on?<br><br>- I'll set up a meeting.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>That one's my favorite.<br><br>Ah, that one's Jules.<br><br>Now, she's my favorite too,<br><br>but don't tell the others<br>or they'll get jealous.<br><br>I see you've met Chloe,<br>my little trooper.<br><br>Yeah, it's great<br>to see young people<br><br>interested in<br>the little blue penguins.<br><br>Do you know,<br>if you study biology,<br><br>you could work in a place...<br><br>just like this.<br><br>- Wow, really?<br>- You bet!<br><br>It's so good<br>you guys could make it.<br><br>I hope you had a great time.<br><br>Oh, absolutely!<br><br>Tilly here was saying<br>you need some pool repairs.<br><br>We'd be happy to help.<br><br>- Uh, you'd... you'd fix the pool?<br>- I'm a small business owner.<br><br>My side business is<br>pool repairs and maintenance.<br><br>That would be an amazing help.<br><br>I can send the guys<br>around in the morning.<br><br>Really? I...<br><br>I can't stress how much<br>of a big deal this is.<br><br>Thank you so much. Yeah, OK,<br>so it's not too big. It's...<br><br>Shall we get some pavlova?<br><br>- Thank you, sir.<br>- Thank you so much.<br><br>- Oh! Thank you. See you!<br>- Thank you!<br><br>Well? Come on.<br><br>We've raised so much money<br><br>that we can now pay for the cost<br>of the urgent repairs,<br><br>plus the cost of the gala!<br><br>That's... I'm blown away.<br>That's amazing.<br><br>And, Gemma,<br>taking photos of the guests<br><br>in exchange for donations?<br><br>That was genius.<br><br>Oh, it's my pleasure.<br><br>It's really hard to get a nice<br>family photo these days.<br><br>They're all either,<br>you know, awful selfies<br><br>or someone's not<br>in it, usually me.<br><br>But it was nice to give people<br>a souvenir of the happy day.<br><br>Oh, and I...<br>I got one of you two.<br><br>- Oh.<br>- Oh!<br><br>And...<br><br>- You look nice.<br>- Thanks.<br><br>We've sold almost<br>all of the tickets to the gala!<br><br>- Go team!<br>- Hear, hear!<br><br>- Seconded!<br>- Thirded!<br><br>I third. I... I agree.<br><br>Anyway, I know that<br>we've made progress,<br><br>but we still need to plan<br>the meeting with the mayor<br><br>and get more scientists<br>on the guest list.<br><br>So who's with me?<br><br>I have to monitor<br>the penguins tonight anyway.<br><br>Do you want to join me?<br><br>OK. As long as<br>I'm not a distraction.<br><br>No. You'd be<br>a welcome distraction.<br><br>- Uh, uh... The work.<br>- The work would be...<br><br>The work would be<br>a welcome distraction.<br><br>- A welcome distraction.<br>- Yes.

OK!<br><br>Aptenodytes Forsteri.<br><br>You think you own the Antarctic.<br><br>You're not the only penguins!<br><br>Knock, knock.<br><br>I didn't mean to interrupt your<br>criticism of emperor penguins.<br><br>Ah, it's not personal, it's...<br><br>- You know their scientific name?<br>- Of course.<br><br>But, I mean, they had it coming,<br>walking around on the tundra,<br><br>thinking they're<br>better than everyone else.<br><br>- Right?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Don't even get me started<br>on king penguins.<br><br>Oh, you mean joker penguins.<br><br>I love that journal.<br><br>The editor used to come in<br>to head office all the time.<br><br>Yeah, it's a good resource,<br>but there's only so many pages<br><br>they're willing<br>to dedicate to penguins.<br><br>Little blue penguins<br>rarely get a mention.<br><br>You should publish something.<br><br>No. I mean, I enjoy writing,<br>but my work really isn't...<br><br>Fletcher, there are two<br>facilities in the entire world<br><br>that handle<br>little blue penguins,<br><br>and you're the head zoologist<br>of one of them.<br><br>I mean, you're likely the<br>leading expert on the subject.<br><br>I'm not that kind of scientist.<br><br>It could raise the profile<br>of the sanctuary,<br><br>not to mention the rest<br>of the scientific community.<br><br>We could put this place<br>back on the map!<br><br>Fletcher, look at me.<br><br>You are an<br>incredible intellectual<br><br>and a talented zoologist.<br><br>I mean, you should<br>give yourself more credit.<br><br>I would read anything you wrote.<br><br>Really?<br><br>For educational purposes,<br>I mean.<br><br>Anyway, what are your thoughts<br>on adding to this guest list?<br><br>Because I...<br><br>- Ah, Dr. Ken Nakamura.<br>- Yep.<br><br>He's the lead ornithologist<br>at the Sydney University.<br><br>Got it.<br><br>Uh, Dr. Philomena Hoofstedder.<br>Two ""Ds"".<br><br>She is head zoologist<br>at the Queensland Zoo.<br><br>I know Jeff Gallow.<br><br>He is the lead researcher<br>on the Royal Penguin Project.<br><br>- Yeah, he's great.<br>- Yep.<br><br>Uh, Gregory Brewer, head of<br>the bird watching association.<br><br>It's always nice<br>when professionals<br><br>acknowledge hobbyists, isn't it?<br><br>Yeah, my thoughts exactly.<br><br>You know, for someone<br>from head office,<br><br>you're doing a pretty<br>good job on the field.<br><br>Aw. Thanks.<br><br>You know,<br>before I left San Diego,<br><br>I applied for<br>the general manager position<br><br>at the Polar Bear Center<br>in Alaska.<br><br>I was eyeing<br>the position for a while,<br><br>but my boss turned me down.<br><br>I'm just ready for this,<br>you know?<br><br>I love being hands on.<br><br>So what does this place<br>have to offer<br><br>in the way of midnight snacks?<br><br>I may have a marshmallow stash<br>for emergency hot chocolate.<br><br>Question is, one or two?<br><br>Four, please.<br><br>- Four?<br>- Yes.<br><br>All right.<br><br>As you can see,<br><br>they're mostly bunkered down<br>at night in their burrows.<br><br>Sounds cozy.<br><br>You know, you never told me<br>why you came to Crystal Bay.<br><br>Was it for a job or...<br><br>No?<br><br>I mean, yes. Sort of.<br><br>There was someone.<br><br>Mmm.<br><br>And she traveled a lot for work,<br><br>but we agreed<br>that we'd both meet here<br><br>and make this our home.<br><br>But...<br><br>she had a change of heart.<br><br>Never showed up at the airport.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>It was the only time<br>I've ever been in love.<br><br>That must have been tough.<br><br>I don't think<br>I've ever felt that before.<br><br>Come with me.<br><br>Where are we going?<br><br>Shhh.<br><br>- This way.<br>- OK.<br><br>- Tilly...<br>- Yes?<br><br>I'd like you to meet...<br><br>Digby and Delilah.<br><br>Wow! They are so cute.<br><br>We found them<br>together last year,<br><br>and they are inseparable.<br><br>These two are currently<br>sitting on their first egg.<br><br>They take turns incubating.<br><br>One will sit on the nest<br>while the other one hunts.<br><br>Do you release them?<br><br>Absolutely. That's why<br>they're away from the others.<br><br>We don't hand-feed<br>Digby and Delilah,<br><br>otherwise they'll lose<br>their hunting instincts.<br><br>- So special.<br>- Mm-hmm.<br><br>Penguins really have<br>the right idea, don't they?<br><br>About what?<br><br>Relationships.<br><br>I mean, they communicate.<br><br>Mmm.<br><br>Build a home.<br><br>Uh, share chores.<br><br>Look out for each other.<br><br>They do.<br><br>They're made for each other,<br><br>from the sea to the shore.<br><br>Step by step.<br><br>I hope to have that one day.<br><br>An egg?<br><br>No.<br><br>A home.<br><br>Hey, looking good!<br><br>Gosh. You know,<br>you could be a professional.<br><br>Yeah? Well, actually, I've<br>decided to return to painting.<br><br>- That's wonderful!<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Did you speak<br>to Bruce yet about...<br><br>Well, we have 3 children<br>and work and a dog and...<br><br>And Kyle and I have 36 penguins.<br><br>You need to make the time.<br><br>Go and call him.<br><br>You'll thank me!<br><br>Fletcher has been in there<br>for a very long time.<br><br>I'm not sure we should have<br>split up our presentations.<br><br>If anyone can convince the<br>mayor to care about penguins,<br><br>it's Fletcher, OK?<br><br>The mayor needs to care<br>before he can allocate funding.<br><br>What I'm worried about<br>is time is slipping away,<br><br>and we only have one evening<br>left to raise $50,000!<br><br>I mean, if the mayor fails<br>to reinstate our funding<br><br>or the Institute<br>stops paying our bills,<br><br>then it's off to New Zealand<br>for our penguins,<br><br>probably in economy.<br><br>I've failed!<br>I'm sorry, Grandfather.<br><br>Don't you talk like that.<br>It ain't over till it's over.<br><br>It's over.<br><br>Uh, what? I mean, he hasn't<br>even seen my mood boards yet.<br><br>I was just about to go in there!<br><br>He said he's heard enough,<br><br>and now he's got another meeting<br>with that guy.<br><br>What is there<br>to talk about, Fletcher?<br><br>This is a no-brainer.<br><br>Well, look, Hail Mary,<br><br>I invited him<br>to the gala tomorrow night.<br><br>But it's a 50/50 chance<br>whether he turns up or not.<br><br>He was very moody.<br><br>Well, it's a start, right?<br><br>You know what?<br><br>We have come this far.<br>So there's only one thing to do.<br><br>- What's that?<br>- Keep going!<br><br>Kids, can you<br>take care of Pickles<br><br>while I take care of this?<br><br>Hang on. Mom's on the phone.<br><br>- Hi!<br>- Hey. Hey, honey?<br><br>What's that noise?<br><br>How are you? Sorry,<br>the fire alarm is going off.<br><br>The kids made pancakes.<br>It's a war zone.<br><br>Hang on. It's just gone off.<br><br>You go down there.<br>That's good.<br><br>How are you? How's Australia?<br>We all miss you so much.<br><br>Oh, I miss you!<br><br>It's beautiful here.<br>You'd love it.<br><br>I would love to be there, honey.<br><br>I'd love to be there.<br><br>We're having a fancy<br>fundraising gala on Friday,<br><br>and I wish you were coming.<br><br>You know you always<br>look so great in a suit.<br><br>In my younger days, maybe.<br><br>Hey, hon, we'll... we'll have<br>that honeymoon one day.<br><br>Maybe when the kids<br>are in college.<br><br>Actually, that's what I wanted<br>to talk to you about, Bruce,<br><br>about making time<br>for ourselves, you know,<br><br>for reconnecting.<br><br>Yeah. Listen, hon...<br><br>Harriet! You stop squirting<br>that toothpaste on the floor.<br><br>It's really important.<br><br>No, no, don't eat it!<br><br>I'm sorry, honey,<br>I'll have to call you later.<br><br>Love you.<br><br>I love you too.<br><br>Moving in?<br><br>I'm trying to find a backup<br>generator for the gala lighting.<br><br>I don't want an overloaded<br>circuit to trip the breaker.<br><br>OK. Good thinking.<br><br>I really thought the mayor<br>would be on board with this.<br><br>We only had a week.<br><br>It's not a lot of time<br>to raise $50,000,<br><br>but, Tilly, if anybody<br>can pull this off, it's you.<br><br>So let's be like the<br>little blue penguins about this<br><br>and just take it<br>step by step, yeah?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>And I thought<br>we already had a generator.<br><br>We do. I just wanted<br>a backup in case.<br><br>OK. Well, I know<br>where there's one.<br><br>Come on. Come on.<br><br>OK.<br><br>You're weird.<br><br>This way.<br><br>Wait...<br><br>Told you. Leaky faucet.<br><br>You live here?<br><br>Uh, yes and no.<br><br>Because of the hours<br>I do at the sanctuary,<br><br>I sort of spend my time<br>between the two.<br><br>Wait, why don't you<br>live in this place?<br><br>It's so cute!<br><br>Well, that's complicated.<br><br>Now, do we need<br>a backup to the backup,<br><br>or will this backup do?<br><br>No, that's perfect.<br>What's complicated?<br><br>Um...<br><br>Well, when my ex didn't<br>show up at the airport,<br><br>I sort of dove straight<br>into work at the sanctuary.<br><br>Didn't really want to look<br>at this place as being a home.<br><br>But I can see<br>what you're saying.<br><br>With a bit of work,<br>it could actually be something.<br><br>It really could.<br><br>Hey! How's it going?<br><br>Good. We're almost<br>ready for the gala.<br><br>Actually, I meant you.<br><br>How are you doing?<br><br>You really seem to like it here.<br><br>I haven't seen you this happy<br>in a long time.<br><br>I do love it here.<br><br>There's no reason why<br>you can't stay a bit longer.<br><br>I can't turn my back on<br>everything I've worked for.<br><br>Yeah, yeah.<br>Just tell me you heard me.<br><br>I heard you.<br><br>Good. Grab your coat.<br><br>- Where are we going?<br>- You'll see!<br><br>Guys! What is this?<br><br>The guest of honor!<br><br>Come on in.<br><br>- And this is for you.<br>- Oh, thank you.<br><br>- This is for you.<br>- Well, thank you.<br><br>Hi, everybody.<br><br>Tilly, I've been<br>the general manager<br><br>of our beloved penguin sanctuary<br><br>for a long time.<br><br>We've seen some people<br>come and go,<br><br>and we've seen<br>some people come and stay,<br><br>and some people<br>I wished would go.<br><br>What I'm trying to say<br><br>is that I've never wished<br>for anybody to stay<br><br>quite as much as you.<br><br>And if the sanctuary<br>remains open...<br><br>we'd love for you to stay.<br><br>But whatever you decide,<br><br>please know that<br>you'll always have a home here.<br><br>- Oh! Yeah.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>That's enough of that.<br>Have some more hot chocolate.<br><br>Who ate all the marshmallows?<br><br>So I took your advice.<br><br>""The Unique Behavioral Traits<br>of Little Blue Penguins<br><br>by Dr. Fletcher Grant.""<br><br>While you were gone,<br><br>the editor of the International<br>Wildlife Journal called to RSVP.<br><br>We exchanged some strong<br>opinions on emperor penguins,<br><br>but he was very interested<br>in our little blue penguins.<br><br>And you were right.<br><br>People do want to hear<br>about the sanctuary.<br><br>And it seems that my writing<br>is good enough to be published.<br><br>That's gonna be<br>in the next issue.<br><br>That is so amazing.<br><br>I am so proud of you.<br><br>Tilly, I...<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>- Would you care to dance?<br>- I would.<br><br>If I wasn't in heels on grass,<br>I certainly would.<br><br>- Just step there.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>May I just say, you are<br>looking divine this evening.<br><br>Oh, well, thank you. I try.<br><br>You see, the cottage is empty.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Perhaps they're out somewhere<br><br>being deliriously happy<br>drinking hot chocolate.<br><br>Perhaps.<br><br>Come on, you two. Come on!<br><br>♪ Long ago,<br>when I was young ♪<br><br>♪ I thought that I<br>was having so much fun ♪<br><br>♪ How could I know any better?<br><br>♪ I was so young<br><br>♪ And my eyes,<br>they could not see ♪<br><br>Wonderful! We can't wait to<br>see you tonight, Dr. Nakamura.<br><br>OK, bye-bye.<br><br>- OK.<br>- Yes!<br><br>Did you check his dietaries?<br><br>- Uh, no fish.<br>- No fish.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Tilly!

Good.<br><br>I am confident that we will<br>secure our funding tonight.<br><br>The community is really<br>engaging with the sanctuary now,<br><br>and I have to admit,<br>I really like this place.<br><br>Outstanding!<br><br>So, I have some<br>really great news.<br><br>Oh!<br><br>The general manager position<br><br>of the Polar Bear<br>Discovery Center,<br><br>it's yours.<br><br>I know you want it.<br><br>We're gonna take<br>a leap of faith.<br><br>I'm... I'm sorry?<br><br>Well, the new guy,<br><br>he's allegedly allergic<br>to bear fur,<br><br>so he's been<br>popping antihistamines<br><br>like they're breath mints.<br><br>So I put you forward.<br><br>And you're just<br>gonna have to forgive me<br><br>for not seeing<br>your potential sooner.<br><br>But you do need to leave ASAP.<br><br>So I'm thinking, like, tonight,<br>after the gala, maybe.<br><br>How does that sound?<br><br>T-tonight? Um...<br><br>I... I... That's just so soon.<br>I, uh...<br><br>Well, you've earned it.<br><br>Now, listen, I'm gonna get going<br><br>so I can do<br>these tracks before dark.<br><br>And, hey, destiny<br>waits for no one.<br><br>OK!

It's perfect.<br><br>It's just, um...<br><br>I got offered the job in Alaska.<br><br>Uh, right.

Um...<br><br>I just thought that maybe<br>you'd found something here.<br><br>I'm so sorry.<br><br>♪ You're looking good<br>in all your getup ♪<br><br>♪ The limo is heading<br>for a joint uptown ♪<br><br>Dr. Nakamura,<br>so glad you could make it!<br><br>Welcome.<br><br>How's my tie?<br><br>Perfect.

Have all<br>the scientists arrived?<br><br>Has anybody seen the mayor?<br><br>I better mingle and try to get<br>as many donations as I can.<br><br>Excuse me.<br><br>Hi!<br><br>Has anyone seen Fletcher,<br>'cause that wasn't him.<br><br>We can promise you<br>that the sanctuary<br><br>will use the council's funding<br>to run research projects<br><br>and educational programs<br><br>that will support<br>and enrich the community<br><br>and raise the profile<br>of Crystal Bay itself.<br><br>Interesting.<br><br>You see, Mr. Mayor,<br><br>the sanctuary used to be<br>a vital part of the community,<br><br>and we want to restore it<br>to its former glory.<br><br>I like the sound of that.<br><br>Well, why don't I take you<br>on a tour of the facility,<br><br>and you can see<br>what we're talking about?<br><br>- Great! Lead the way.<br>- Right this way.<br><br>Hey! Oh...<br><br>How did that go?<br><br>Ah, getting there.<br>Kyle's off working his magic.<br><br>Fingers crossed.<br><br>Hey, I, uh...<br>I got you a parting gift.<br><br>- Gemma, you shouldn't have.<br>- Just open it!<br><br>- Really?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>It's your very own record.<br><br>It's beautiful!<br><br>Gemma, I love it. Thank you.<br><br>Well, you helped me<br>find a bit of myself here,<br><br>and I... I wanted to thank you.<br><br>From one artist to another.<br><br>I guess now's a good time<br>for me to give you your gift.<br><br>Hello, beautiful. It's me.<br><br>Oh! Oh!<br><br>I missed you.<br><br>How did you get...<br><br>I can't take the credit for it.<br><br>I just picked him up<br>from the airport.<br><br>I heard what you<br>were trying to say,<br><br>so I booked a vacation<br>in Crystal Bay for two weeks,<br><br>and I ordered extra pillows,<br>just for you.<br><br>I mean, we deserve<br>a honeymoon now.<br><br>- And the kids?<br>- Don't worry.<br><br>They're with my Mom.<br>It's all under control.<br><br>Hey, hey, hey...<br><br>This is our time now.<br><br>I love you.<br><br>Let me show you around.<br><br>I am so glad you came.<br><br>I gotta tell you,<br>it's pretty impressive.<br><br>Well, I'm just happy to help.<br><br>It got off to<br>a pretty strong start,<br><br>but, uh, you still<br>have a long way to go.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Kyle, Parker, this is my boss,<br><br>Mackenzie Waterhouse<br>from head office.<br><br>Oh. Yes, of course.<br><br>It's good to have you here<br>in person to see what we do.<br><br>Oh, thank you.<br><br>Can I just say,<br>Mr. Waterhouse,<br><br>that Tilly has done<br>an outstanding job.<br><br>She's worked tirelessly<br><br>and shown us all<br>the spirit of community.<br><br>Well, I agree.<br><br>She is incredible,<br>which is why she's off to Alaska<br><br>to look after<br>the Polar Bear Center.<br><br>I'm sure you've<br>told them the good news.<br><br>Uh...<br><br>It's the kind of position<br>I've been wanting<br><br>for a really long time,<br>and, um...<br><br>It doesn't mean that this place<br>isn't very special to me.<br><br>Of course not, Tilly. Congratulations.<br><br>When do you leave?<br><br>Uh... Tonight,<br>after the party?<br><br>She needs to leave ASAP.<br><br>It's a two-day journey<br>just to get there.<br><br>- Sounds remote.<br>- Exactly.<br><br>Check your phone.<br>I sent 3 playlists.<br><br>It's a 4-hour journey<br>to the closest community, so...<br><br>- OK.<br>- Yeah. Oh! Crab cakes.<br><br>You'll excuse me. Sir!<br><br>Why aren't<br>the donations increasing?<br><br>We've only hit the halfway mark.<br><br>I've spoken to the mayor<br>and given him the grand tour,<br><br>but he was tight-lipped<br>about restoring our funding.<br><br>I just don't know<br>which way he'll go.<br><br>I'll ask Fletcher to do<br>one of his penguin talks.<br><br>That might get people excited.<br><br>It's worth a shot.<br>I'll help you find him.<br><br>What are you doing?<br><br>I don't have a choice.<br><br>No. You want to know<br>who didn't have a choice? Us.<br><br>You remember<br>when we were little?<br><br>Being pulled out of school<br>every 5 minutes<br><br>so we could move again.<br><br>Ah, Tilly, I...<br><br>I watched you<br>trying so hard to fit in.<br><br>And every time<br>you made a new friend,<br><br>you had to say goodbye again.<br><br>I'm not watching you<br><br>push away these people<br>you really care about.<br><br>I'm never doing it again.<br><br>Hey, I'm your sister.<br><br>We're family.<br><br>Family look out for each other.<br><br>Like your little penguins.<br><br>Hey.<br><br>Right now, you are about to<br>make a big mistake.<br><br>Hello? Uh...<br><br>Is this thing working?<br>Uh, hello?<br><br>Uh, is this thing working?<br><br>Uh, OK! Good evening, everyone.<br><br>My name is Dr. Fletcher Grant,<br><br>and I am the head zoologist<br><br>at the Crystal Bay<br>Penguin Sanctuary.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Uh, the work we do<br>is important here,<br><br>um, looking after our colony<br>of little blue penguins.<br><br>And, um...<br><br>And, um...<br><br>I really thought<br>that we were going to<br><br>save our sanctuary tonight.<br><br>Um, but it appears that fate<br>has ruled against us.<br><br>And that's OK,<br><br>because sometimes we have to<br><br>accept what<br>we've lost, because...<br><br>losing is part of life.<br><br>Um, please enjoy your evening<br><br>and, uh, make sure<br>you eat the crab cakes.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Uh, wait, everyone!<br>I just... One moment.<br><br>Ladies and gentlemen, sorry!<br><br>One moment. Um... Hi!<br><br>My name is Tilly Monterey.<br><br>And up until about a week ago,<br><br>I knew about as much as you do<br><br>about the Crystal Bay<br>Penguin Sanctuary.<br><br>In fact, I didn't even know<br>where Crystal Bay was.<br><br>Um...<br><br>But in that time,<br><br>I've learned a lot<br>about little blue penguins.<br><br>I've learned that they are the<br>smallest penguins in the world!<br><br>I've learned how well<br>they take care of each other.<br><br>They really look out<br>for their neighbors.<br><br>Life isn't easy<br>for these little guys.<br><br>Sometimes, they will come home<br>with a belly full of food<br><br>or come home hungry<br><br>or find someone they like and<br>convince them to sit on an egg.<br><br>We all need<br>a little help sometimes<br><br>to help fix things,<br><br>to help give us advice,<br><br>to make the best pavlovas<br>in the world.<br><br>Crystal Bay is...<br><br>Pavlova makes everything better.<br><br>An amazing place.<br><br>And the little blue penguins<br>are our neighbors.<br><br>And I think it's time...<br><br>to be good neighbors to them.<br><br>Because they're not that<br>different from us, right?<br><br>I mean, don't we all feel<br>a little small, sometimes?<br><br>Don't we all feel afraid<br><br>when we don't know<br>what's gonna happen next?<br><br>You know, for the longest time,<br><br>all I ever wanted to do<br>was good work<br><br>and travel to<br>extraordinary places<br><br>and to make a difference.<br><br>And I think I can do that here.<br><br>Because this is where<br>I'm needed most and, um...<br><br>this is where I belong, so...<br><br>thank you.<br><br>Let's ensure that the<br>Crystal Bay Penguin Sanctuary<br><br>is here to stay<br>for years to come.<br><br>Your grandfather<br>would be so proud.<br><br>Hey. Tilly's gonna be<br>great here.<br><br>So proud of her.<br><br>- Thank you.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>This is where I belong.<br>With you.<br><br>We can take it step by step.<br><br>Just like the penguins.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Aw!<br><br>MELS</div>",https://subslikescript.com/movie/Love_and_Penguins-15051960

He and Jake<br>were two years ahead of me.<br><br>Oh, you were all friends.<br><br>I wouldn't say that.<br><br>Brooks was always at our house,<br><br>but he just teased me relentlessly.<br><br>He was always picking on me.<br><br>I couldn't stand to be<br>in the same room with him.<br><br>Oh. A bully?<br><br>Oh, no, nothing like that.<br><br>You know he was just...<br><br>popular and athletic, handsome.<br><br>You know, that type.<br><br>I swear I was the only girl<br>in school<br><br>that didn't treat him<br>like royalty.<br><br>- No wonder he liked you.<br>- What?<br><br>No.<br><br>Though there was that time...<br><br>What?<br><br>Oh, nothing.<br><br>It's such a long time ago,<br>it's meaningless now.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- It was his senior year<br><br>and he was hanging out<br>at our house waiting for Jake.<br><br>Eating everything<br>in the kitchen, I might add.<br><br>And he happened to mention<br>that he didn't have a date<br><br>for the Winter<br>Snow Ball dance...<br><br>What happened?<br><br>Well, he said that he would<br>have a better time<br><br>going with me than any<br>of the other girls in school.<br><br>Okay, maybe I didn't dislike him<br><br>as much as I thought<br>I did back then.<br><br>I thought he meant what he said.<br><br>I thought I was his date.<br><br>The night of the dance,<br>he never showed up.<br><br>Come to find out he took<br>Erin Smythe,<br><br>captain of<br>the cheerleaders instead.<br><br>Oh, no.<br><br>Did he have any idea that<br>he thought he'd asked you?<br><br>Probably not.<br><br>I don't know, I avoided<br>talking to him after that.<br><br>And then he moved<br>after graduation.<br><br>I'm sorry. It must've<br>been devastating<br><br>to your sweet little<br>teenage heart.<br><br>Yeah, well, it was at the time.<br><br>Now I just hope he remains<br>a silent partner that stays...<br><br>Hello!<br><br>Or not.<br><br>Oh, hi!<br><br>Good morning.<br><br>Alright, ready to get started.<br><br>Jake used to bring me here<br>all the time.<br><br>It's like my favourite place.<br><br>Your parents were always<br>so nice to me.<br><br>Um... what are you doing?<br><br>Um...

papers that you have.<br><br>Brooks, what are you<br>talking about?<br><br>I'm talking about<br>the loan documents.<br><br>Unfortunately for you,<br>I overheard you<br><br>talking to the bank manager.<br><br>So please don't worry.<br><br>I'm not gonna cause<br>any problems.<br><br>Brooks, is that<br>what you thought?<br><br>That I would confront you<br>about leaving me in the lurch<br><br>and I'd go behind your back<br>and get a secret loan<br><br>to buy you out of the business?<br><br>I told Tim<br>I don't want the loan.<br><br>I had him cancel it.<br><br>Yeah, yes, at first,<br>I did want it, but...<br><br>that was before<br>I got to know you.<br><br>I had the contract in my hand...<br><br>and I couldn't sign it.<br><br>- You didn't sign it?<br>- No.<br><br>Why

changing.<br><br>Well, life is for<br>the living, but...<br><br>he who is living must be<br>prepared for changes.<br><br>Is that my high school<br>yearbook quote?<br><br>What about you,<br>why didn't you take the loan?<br><br>What changed your mind?<br><br>Well, I might have<br>fallen in love with you.<br><br>You might have?<br><br>I have fallen in love with you.<br><br>And it's wonderful<br>and

That elephant.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Apology accepted.<br><br>You should probably<br>go find Jade.<br><br>Look, I'm sorry that I hurt you.<br><br>But over the last two years,<br>I've grown<br><br>and I realize now that I made<br><br>the biggest mistake<br>of my life letting you go.<br><br>It's fine.<br><br>I'm fine.<br><br>And, uh, this-this is, um,<br><br>this is over, so...<br><br>we're both fine, and...<br><br>Zoey, I still care about you.<br><br>Todd, don't do this, please.<br><br>Can we just talk this week?<br><br>Just the two of us.<br><br>There's so much<br>I need to tell you.<br><br>Todd. I...<br><br>Todd!<br>Hi.<br><br>Jade is just up the street<br>checking out the men's shop.<br><br>Great. Ms. Jensen,<br>you look stunning.<br><br>Why, thank you.<br>Do you like the hat?<br><br>Ooh, love it. Ties the whole<br>outfit together beautifully.<br><br>That's what I thought.<br><br>Well, I, uh, better find Jade.<br><br>I'll see you guys<br>back at the resort.<br><br>Bye.<br><br>Oh!<br><br>That dress, it's perfect.<br><br>Oh, no.<br>What's wrong, honey?<br><br>Mom, I think we're gonna need<br>to make another stop<br><br>on the way back.<br><br>Double sorbet scoop?<br><br>Make it a triple.<br><br>So, let me get this straight:<br><br>you and the handsome doctor<br>are not dating.<br><br>You're just pretending to<br>so Todd thinks you're happy.<br><br>- Correct.<br>- And Todd,<br><br>who left you a week<br>before the wedding<br><br>three years ago,<br>still cares about you<br><br>and wants to talk.<br><br>It appears so.<br><br>And you'd rather run and hide<br><br>for another three years<br><br>than to have an honest<br>conversation with Todd.<br><br>That about sums it up.<br><br>I also wanted to<br>give this back to him,<br><br>but I just can't seem<br>to find the words.<br><br>Oh, that does deserve<br>three scoops of ice cream.<br><br>I know.<br><br>Do you still<br>have feelings for Todd?<br><br>I have a lot of feelings<br>for Todd.<br><br>In fact, I have<br>all the feelings for Todd:<br><br>love, hate, anger, confusion.<br><br>I don't know whether<br>I wanna forgive him,<br><br>or murder him with this spoon.<br><br>You'd probably need<br>a bigger spoon.<br><br>Not the time, honey.<br><br>I was ready to spend the rest<br>of my life with Todd.<br><br>Then he broke my heart.<br>And my trust.<br><br>Oh, sweetheart.<br><br>Unfortunately, in life,<br>things will break your heart<br><br>in a million pieces.<br><br>You can't avoid that.<br><br>But you cannot allow<br>those things<br><br>to also break your spirit.<br>And it seems to me<br><br>you allowed this situation<br>with Todd to break yours.<br><br>Maybe a little.<br><br>You're allowing fear<br>to control your life!<br><br>I think it's time you put your<br>big girl pants on<br><br>and take your life back, honey.<br><br>I have an extra pair<br>if you need them.<br><br>I think you're right,<br>Mrs. Jensen.<br><br>But, first, can we<br>finish our ice cream?<br><br>Luckily, the dress I bought<br>is stretchy.<br><br>Welcome to our first annual<br>water race.<br><br>All right, all right.<br><br>So, the goal<br>is to get to the island<br><br>as fast as you can<br>with your partner<br><br>and retrieve the flag.<br><br>The first one back at the docks<br>with their flag wins.<br><br>- Right, let's get ready.<br>- Whoo!<br><br>Remember: slow and steady<br>wins the race.<br><br>Hm. Not sure<br>that applies here.<br><br>Worked for the turtle.<br><br>You do seem a lot more<br>comfortable on the water<br><br>than up in the trees.<br><br>Yeah, I learned how to swim.<br>Haven't quite mastered the whole<br><br>flying thing yet.<br><br>Mm. Makes sense.<br><br>I grew up on the lake.<br>I love it out here.<br><br>What about you?<br>Where are you from?<br><br>I'm a city boy.<br><br>- Really?<br>- Mm-hm.<br><br>What brought you to<br>this quaint cottage town?<br><br>My grandfather has a place here<br><br>and I loved spending<br>summers with him as a child.<br><br>When I was applying for jobs,<br>it was the first place<br><br>I thought of.<br><br>I think it'd be a really nice<br>place to raise a family.<br><br>That's sweet. Is your<br>grandfather still around?<br><br>He is. He is. He used to<br>run a flower shop in town<br><br>with my grandmother.<br><br>He's retired now, but he's got a<br>pretty impressive garden.<br><br>Hm, well, I'd love<br>to see it sometime.<br><br>- I'd love to show you.<br>- Let's go!<br><br>Good luck, everyone!<br><br>On your mark, get set...<br><br>Go!<br><br>Let's go!<br><br>Remember: slow and steady<br>wins the race.<br><br>Are you sure<br>slow and steady wins the race?<br><br>I think we might be in trouble.<br><br>Oh, yeah, that turtle was wrong.<br><br>Okay, let's focus.<br>We need to find that flag.<br><br>What's our strategy.<br><br>Oh...<br><br>Eeny-meeny-miny-mo?<br><br>I like your style.<br><br>Okay, let's go.<br><br>Oh. Hey.<br><br>Hi.<br><br>Guys, yay, allies.<br>This is perfect.<br><br>Have you found anything yet?<br><br>- Nope.<br>- Not yet.<br><br>These flags are so well-hidden.<br><br>Marvin does<br>like a good challenge.<br><br>So do I.<br><br>Okay, uh, good luck to you two.<br><br>Wait! Allies.<br>Let's work together.<br><br>That is a great idea.<br><br>- Is it?<br>- Better yet,<br><br>let's divide and conquer.<br><br>Yes. Divide.<br><br>Zoey and I will go down<br>by the river.<br><br>You and Todd<br>go by the rock face.<br><br>Holler if anyone finds anything.<br><br>Ooh, I want to<br>check out the river,<br><br>- so I'll go with Dr. Clark.<br>- Great.<br><br>Looks like you and I are a team.<br><br>- What? Um, no.<br>- Oh, that's perfect.<br><br>Come on, Doc.<br><br>- Back here in a few minutes?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>We'll holler<br>if we find anything.<br><br>Come on, Doc.<br>Tick-tock!<br><br>Well, we have a few minutes,<br>Zoey. Think we need to talk.<br><br>Not the time or the place, Todd.<br><br>- Keep your eyes on the prize.<br>- They are and I am.<br><br>Zoey, there's so much<br>I need to tell you.<br><br>- Not now.<br>- Then when?<br><br>You haven't picked up<br>any of your phone calls<br><br>and I tried calling you<br>a bunch of times last year.<br><br>Well, I don't pick up<br>unsolicited calls.<br><br>- Zoey!<br>- We have a flag to find.<br><br>So, how long have you<br>and Zoey been together?<br><br>It's fairly new.<br><br>Cool.<br><br>Yeah, me and Todd have been<br>dating for five months now.<br><br>It's pretty awesome.<br><br>That's great.<br><br>Hey, how did you and Zoey meet?<br><br>Oh, we were, um...<br><br>Oh!<br>There's a flag.<br><br>Awesome!<br><br>Good call in checking<br>down by the river.<br><br>Do you think you can reach it?<br><br>Yeah.

This is yours.<br><br>The ring?<br>No, Zoey, it's yours.<br><br>I want you to keep it.<br><br>There's so much<br>I want to tell you.<br><br>I'm closing this chapter, Todd.<br><br>I need you to listen closely<br>to what I have to say.<br><br>Ah.<br><br>Hey, guys.<br><br>We found one of the flags.<br><br>Am I interrupting something?<br><br>No, not at all.<br><br>You found a flag.<br>That's great.<br><br>Yeah.<br>Any luck here?<br><br>Unfortunately, no.<br>No luck here.<br><br>Hey!<br><br>Here.<br><br>You take the flag.<br>We'll keep looking.<br><br>No, we're a team.<br>We'll-we'll stay with you guys.<br><br>No, you guys can go ahead.<br><br>I'm gonna grab<br>a few photos, anyway.<br><br>- You sure?<br>- Positive.<br><br>Okay, well,<br><br>thanks for the help.<br>Allies!<br><br>- You okay?<br>- Been better.<br><br>You wanna talk about it?<br><br>Nope.<br><br>Hey, how badly do<br>you wanna win this race?<br><br>About a zero out of ten<br>right now.<br><br>Great, 'cause I have an idea.<br><br>It's a ten.<br>I promise.<br><br>This is stunning. How did you<br>know about this place?<br><br>My grandfather<br>showed me this spot.<br><br>I like to come here<br>from time to time<br><br>and think things through.<br><br>I can see why!<br><br>What a perfect place<br>to take photos.<br><br>Thought you'd like it.<br><br>Has wedding photography<br>always been a passion of yours?<br><br>Uh, yes and no.<br><br>I actually don't do<br>wedding photography anymore.<br><br>Well, that's curious<br><br>considering you're<br>the wedding photographer.<br><br>I was doing it as a favour.<br><br>I do pet photography now.<br><br>Pet photography?<br><br>Yeah, you know:<br><br>pet weddings, pet portraits,<br>pets with Santa.<br><br>People do pet weddings?<br><br>Mm-hm.<br>More than you think.<br><br>- Receptions?<br>- The whole nine yards.<br><br>- Wow.<br>- Right?<br><br>So, why the change?<br><br>One guess.<br><br>Mr. Marginally Tall<br>and Handsome?<br><br>- You're good at this game.<br>- Mm-hm.<br><br>After our wedding was canceled,<br><br>I couldn't bring myself<br><br>to shoot happy couples<br>every weekend.<br><br>Animals are different.<br><br>Mm. Smart.<br><br>I'd be lying if I didn't<br>tell you that I hadn't thought<br><br>about jumping ship<br>and becoming a vet.<br><br>- Seriously?<br>- No.<br><br>Oh, okay.<br><br>But I can see why it would<br>have its advantages.<br><br>I did think about quitting once.<br><br>Really? Why?<br><br>It was the beginning<br>of my career.<br><br>The first few months<br>were amazing.<br><br>And I was really making<br>a difference in people's lives.<br><br>I thought it was the best career<br>in the world.<br><br>So, what happened?<br><br>I, um...<br><br>I lost my first patient.<br><br>I'm so sorry.<br><br>It was extremely difficult.<br><br>I just couldn't stop thinking<br>if there was something more<br><br>I could have done, you know?<br><br>I'm sure you did<br>everything you could.<br><br>Well...<br><br>It didn't stop me<br>from wondering.<br><br>I lost myself<br>for a little bit after that.<br><br>How did you find your way back?<br><br>Good friends, time<br><br>and realizing that there's<br>certain things in our lives<br><br>that we can't control.<br><br>When life throws us challenges,<br>we can't change who we are.<br><br>Hm.<br><br>I feel like there's a lesson<br>you're trying to share here.<br><br>- Me?<br>- Mm-hm.<br><br>No! No, not at all.<br><br>Just...<br><br>making conversation.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>I appreciate it.<br><br>That was fun.<br>Thanks, Clark, I needed that.<br><br>I'm sorry we didn't win.<br><br>Uh, that's the last time<br>I take advice from a turtle.<br><br>Zoey!

It-it was lie.<br><br>Clark and I are not together.<br><br>So you still love me?<br><br>How do you think I feel?<br><br>Of course I still love you.<br><br>Zoey, I still love you, too.<br><br>When I saw your name<br><br>on the guest list,<br><br>I canceled my trip<br><br>so I could see you.<br><br>Please...<br><br>just keep it.<br><br>Guys, I, um...<br><br>I have to go.<br><br>No.<br><br>No.<br><br>I was ready to spend<br>the rest of my life with you.<br><br>Those feelings don't<br>just disappear,<br><br>but I've moved on with my life<br><br>and-and we are never<br>going to get back together.<br><br>It's over.<br><br>And let me give you<br>one solid piece of advice:<br><br>you have a lovely girl in there<br>who loves you back<br><br>and you're being a jerk.<br><br>If you love her,<br>you need to tell her<br><br>and, if you don't,<br>you need to be honest with her<br><br>before she invests any more time<br>and emotions into you.<br><br>Here.<br><br>Is everything okay?<br><br>Yeah.<br>For the first time,<br><br>everything is perfect.<br><br>Well, that sounds promising.<br><br>It is. You ready to rock<br>this competition?<br><br>- I sure am.<br>- Great. Let's do it.<br><br>Five, six, seven and eight.<br><br>I think two left feet<br>and two right feet<br><br>really do complement each other.<br><br>We made a pretty good team<br>up there.<br><br>We really did.<br><br>So, what happens<br>after the wedding?<br><br>You heading home?<br><br>Marvin actually offered me<br>the official position<br><br>of wedding photographer<br>at the resort.<br><br>Sounds like a pretty good offer.<br><br>It is.<br><br>And I think I'm gonna take it.<br><br>I can keep some clients<br>in the city for the week<br><br>and come back here and shoot<br>weddings on the weekend.<br><br>Does that mean you're over<br>your fear of weddings?<br><br>I think I might be.<br><br>So, I saw Todd<br><br>followed you out earlier.<br><br>Did you have a chance<br>to clear the air?<br><br>Yeah, I-I did.<br><br>- And...?<br>- And...<br><br>I think I'm finally free.<br><br>Thank you, Clark, for being<br>there for me this weekend<br><br>and all your advice.<br><br>It's been magical.<br><br>Zoey,<br><br>spending time with you<br>has been...<br><br>magical for me too.<br><br>Well, I guess you can add<br>mending hearts<br><br>on your list of expertise.<br><br>- Can I?<br>- Mm-hm.<br><br>Zoey!<br>There you are.<br><br>We have a problem.<br><br>- Is everything okay?<br>- No, not okay.<br><br>Sorry, Clark, I need to<br>talk to Zoey. Now.<br><br>Okay, um, I'll see you tomorrow?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.<br><br>What's going on?<br><br>Brianna, hi.<br><br>You finally made it.<br><br>I did. Flight got delayed<br>and I had to spend all day<br><br>at the airport. It was so dry.<br>Brutal on the skin.<br><br>Brianna, show her.<br><br>- Right.<br>- Show me what?<br><br>Mm, no easy way to say this...<br><br>What's going on?<br><br>It's about Jade's blog.<br><br>What about it?<br><br>Do they not like<br>the photo shoot?<br><br>Do they not like me anymore?<br><br>Kids today are so fickle,<br>am I right?<br><br>Oh, honey, they really<br>don't like you,<br><br>but it has nothing to do<br>with the photo shoot.<br><br>What do you mean?<br><br>When I landed<br>and checked my phone,<br><br>her latest post was trending.<br><br>What does that mean?<br><br>It means Jade's latest blog<br>had more viewers<br><br>than the six o'clock news.<br><br>Okay, what does this<br>have to do with me?<br><br>Better if you just watch it.<br><br>If you know<br>what I mean.<br><br>And speaking of<br>a girl's best friend,<br><br>I got Zoey to help<br>get some details.<br><br>So, let's be super sneaky<br>and see how it's going.<br><br>Shh.<br><br>So, you love Clark?<br><br>No. No, Todd.<br><br>It was lie.<br><br>Clark and I are not together.<br><br>So you still love me?<br><br>How do you think I feel?<br><br>Of course I still love you.<br><br>Zoey, I still love you, too.<br><br>When I saw your name<br>on the guest list,<br><br>I canceled my trip so<br>I could see you.<br><br>Please, just keep it.<br><br>O-o-okay, but that-that's<br>not what happened.<br><br>I-I mean it, it was,<br>but Todd and I are not...<br><br>I, uh, I have to go.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>How many people have seen this?<br><br>More viewers than<br>the six o'clock news, honey.<br><br>Not to belittle this issue,<br>but we have bigger problems.<br><br>What could possibly<br>be worse than this?<br><br>Our bookings for the month.<br><br>Two of our weddings canceled.<br><br>Apparently, they're big fans<br>of Jade's and now they feel<br><br>it's bad mojo<br>to get married here.<br><br>But they can't cancel.<br><br>You've already<br>booked everything:<br><br>the food, the flowers,<br>the cake, the staff.<br><br>If they cancel,<br>then it'll be a disaster.<br><br>Oh, it's a disaster.<br><br>How do I fix this?<br><br>I don't think<br>you can fix this, Zee.<br><br>This is all my fault.<br><br>It's not your fault.<br>I just thought you should know.<br><br>I'll call the<br>suppliers tomorrow.<br><br>Maybe we can<br>salvage our deposits.<br><br>I'll try to talk to Jade.<br><br>I knew I shouldn't have come.<br><br>I'll, um...<br><br>I'll call my friend to do<br>your wedding photos tomorrow.<br><br>I think it's best<br>that I'm not here.<br><br>Jade will probably<br>change her mind<br><br>and-and come back<br>if I'm gone, but...<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>Oh, Lloyd...<br><br>What have I done?<br><br>I knew we should have<br>stayed home.<br><br>Me and weddings just don't mix.<br><br>Fur and feathers - that's what<br>I'm sticking to from now on.<br><br>Clark.<br><br>Can I come in?<br><br>Uh, yeah, sure.<br><br>Were you gonna leave<br>without saying goodbye?<br><br>I take it you heard.<br><br>I did.<br><br>Look, it's-it's not<br>what it looked like.<br><br>She captured a very small part<br>of a very big conversation.<br><br>Zoey, it's none of my business.<br><br>The conversation with Todd<br>should have been private<br><br>- no matter what you discussed.<br>- I ruined everything.<br><br>It's not your fault, Zoey.<br><br>Yes.<br>Yes, it is.<br><br>But, look, I want you to know<br>that I told him the truth,<br><br>that we are never going to<br>get back together and...<br><br>whatever feelings I had left<br><br>was just a part of the process<br>of letting him go.<br><br>Were you<br>telling the truth about us?<br><br>- About us?<br>- When you said<br><br>there was nothing between us,<br>that it was just a lie.<br><br>Clark...<br><br>I don't, I don't know<br>how I feel.<br><br>I should have stayed home.<br>I even managed to hurt you.<br><br>Zoey...<br><br>Look, I'm leaving<br>first thing in the morning.<br><br>- Let's talk about this.<br>- I'm done talking.<br><br>I really thought<br>this was the beginning<br><br>of something special.<br><br>I'm sorry, Clark.<br><br>I...<br><br>I can't do this.<br><br>I'm sorry, too.<br><br>You take care, buddy.<br><br>Don't look at me like that.<br><br>He doesn't have fur or feathers.<br><br>He's better off without me.<br><br>Oh. It's you.<br><br>You leaving?<br><br>Yes.<br>Happy?<br><br>Now you can have Todd<br>all to yourself<br><br>if this cab ever shows up.<br><br>No, not happy, and trust me,<br>I do not want Todd.<br><br>- You want a ride?<br>- What?<br><br>A ride. That cab<br>is never gonna get here.<br><br>I can drive you.<br>Maybe we can talk.<br><br>I don't wanna talk.<br><br>Okay.<br>All right.<br><br>But I do need a ride.<br><br>I can be silent.<br><br>- Fine.<br>- Great.<br><br>Good.<br><br>Come on, let's go.<br><br>Okay, jump up.<br><br>Jump up.<br><br>Good job.<br><br>Hmm...<br><br>Just gotta...<br><br>What?<br><br>You can speak.<br><br>You just gotta<br>jiggle the lock a little.<br><br>It-it sticks.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>So, why are you leaving?<br><br>Dr. Zappy and Stupid Todd<br>weren't enough for you?<br><br>Did you just call him<br>Stupid Todd?<br><br>I did.<br><br>I'm not hating that name.<br><br>It's not funny.<br><br>It's not funny.<br>Why are you laughing?<br><br>And why are you leaving?<br><br>It's a long story.<br><br>Do you have time for a pit stop<br>before you head home?<br><br>I feel like we have<br>a lot to talk about.<br><br>Hm.<br><br>I've never had ice cream<br>before breakfast before.<br><br>Is this even legal?<br><br>Only in emergencies.<br><br>Well, I think it's too late<br>for a 9-1-1 call.<br><br>I got the 4-1-1 last night,<br>thank you very much.<br><br>Great.<br><br>I can't believe<br>you did this to me.<br><br>I thought you were my friend.<br><br>And you said that you<br>had no feelings for Todd.<br><br>I know, I know,<br>and I'm so sorry,<br><br>but it's complicated.<br><br>Seemed pretty clear to me.<br><br>That ring was meant for you<br>and not for me.<br><br>Jade, it's not<br>what it looked like.<br><br>Yes, it was my ring,<br>but it was from three years ago.<br><br>And I'm the one<br>who gave it back to him.<br><br>The truth is,<br><br>Todd left me a week before<br>our wedding three years ago<br><br>and it's the first time<br>I'm seeing him since.<br><br>What?<br><br>There's things to figure out,<br><br>feelings to work out.<br><br>I haven't been on a date<br><br>and gone to a wedding<br>in three years.<br><br>I don't...<br><br>I don't understand.<br><br>I've stopped doing<br>wedding photography<br><br>because the thought of<br>watching people in love and-and<br><br>getting married every weekend<br>was just too much for me.<br><br>Okay, one moment,<br><br>'cuz between this dairy<br>and this drama,<br><br>this is a lot to digest.<br><br>I know, I know.<br>Ask me any questions you want.<br><br>You said you hadn't<br>dated in years.<br><br>So, what about Dr. Gorgeous?<br>What's going on between you two?<br><br>A decoy.<br><br>I met him here<br>while I was checking in<br><br>and he saw that I was panicking<br>and offered to help me.<br><br>I didn't want Todd to see<br>how hurt I was<br><br>so he pretended<br>to be my boyfriend.<br><br>It's pretty convincing.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Yeah, it grew into something<br>more for both of us, I think.<br><br>Not that it matters anymore.<br><br>And that conversation<br>that I walked in on<br><br>with you and Todd<br>about your feelings?<br><br>A very small part of a<br>very big conversation.<br><br>Of course I still love Todd.<br><br>I was ready to spend the rest<br>of my life with him.<br><br>But I'm not in love<br>with him anymore.<br><br>And, after last night,<br>I can finally say<br><br>that I'm free<br>of all things Todd.<br><br>I just needed to confront him<br>and let all my feelings out<br><br>so that I can finally move on.<br><br>But there is nothing<br>between Todd and I.<br><br>- There isn't?<br>- No, not for me.<br><br>Not anymore.<br><br>You've moved on?<br><br>Well, I did,<br>until I saw your post,<br><br>then I ran from everything.<br><br>Again.<br><br>Right.<br><br>Look,<br><br>I'm so sorry, Jade.<br><br>I'm sorry I wasn't honest<br>with you from the beginning.<br><br>You're a good person and-and<br>you deserve good friends<br><br>and you deserve<br>a good boyfriend.<br><br>I thought I had both.<br><br>Well, I can't vouch for Todd.<br><br>That's something the two of you<br>will have to<br><br>figure out on your own, but...<br><br>you do have good friends<br>in your corner.<br><br>Marvin and Kenny have been<br>raving about you all weekend.<br><br>And if you'll forgive me,<br><br>I would love to be<br>your friend, too.<br><br>Really?<br><br>I would.<br><br>I'd really like that.<br><br>And I owe you<br>an apology, as well.<br><br>You do?<br><br>I should have never streamed<br>a private conversation.<br><br>I crossed the line.<br>I was wrong.<br><br>How about we start over?<br><br>- I'd like that.<br>- Friends?<br><br>Friends.<br><br>So, what next?<br><br>We both stop running<br>and
